description: Author or interpret KID (Keyword Item Distributor) `_KID.ini` files — runtime, no-ESP distribution of keywords onto items (weapons, armor, ammo, magic effects, potions, scrolls, books, soul gems, spells, enchantments, and more), from the bundled KID grammar reference. Use when the user wants to write or fix a `_KID` ini, add or distribute a keyword to items, tag all iron weapons / heavy armor / food / soul gems / a whole mod's gear with a keyword, filter items by name, archetype, equip slot, enchanted or templated state, or damage/armor/weight range, set up an `ExclusiveGroup` of mutually-exclusive keywords — or asks what an existing `_KID.ini` does, whether a given item gets a keyword from it, why a line isn't applying, or to audit or review a mod's KID lines. This is keywords on ITEMS — keywords on NPCs are SPID, items in containers are CID, editing a record's own fields is SkyPatcher. Load before writing or reading any KID line — a misread token silently changes what gets tagged.

# KID Authoring

## Overview

KID (Keyword Item Distributor, by powerofthree) is an SKSE plugin that **adds keywords to items** —
weapons, armor, ammo, magic effects, potions, scrolls, books, soul gems, spells, enchantments, and
more (19 item types) — **at game startup**, driven by plain-text `_KID.ini` files. It writes nothing
to plugins or saves; it re-applies its keywords from scratch on each launch, so a KID mod is trace-free
to add or remove. This skill composes correct KID lines and places the file, drawing every type,
filter, trait, value, and example from the bundled grammar reference in `references/`.

It is a **procedural** skill with a **reference-lookup** core — the look-it-up-never-invent discipline
that `papyrus-reference`, `mutagen-reference`, and the sibling `spid-authoring` / `skypatcher-authoring`
use, because a fabricated KID token fails silently (see "Bundled-or-warn").

**Scope boundary — the deciding question is what receives the keyword:**
- a keyword onto an **item record** (weapon/armor/potion/…) → **KID** (this skill).
- a spell/perk/item/keyword onto an **NPC** → `spid-authoring`. (SPID also distributes *keywords*, but
  to NPCs — if the target is an NPC, it's SPID, not KID.)
- an item into a **container** → CID.
- changing a record's **own fields** (a weapon's damage, an NPC's stats) → `skypatcher-authoring`.
  SkyPatcher can also add keywords *as part of* editing a record; reach for KID when adding keywords by
  item-filter is the whole job.

## First step — open the grammar reference

KID has one uniform line grammar, so there's no per-type resolution to do up front — open the reference
and read the parts your task touches:

1. **`references/grammar-core.md`** — read first. The 5-section line, file discovery (`_KID.ini` in
   `Data\`), startup timing, the keyword id (incl. dynamic creation), chance, and the `ExclusiveGroup`
   feature. Almost every task needs it.
2. **`references/types.md`** — the 19 item types, their xEdit signatures, and which carry traits. Pick
   the one type your line targets.
3. **`references/filters.md`** — section 2: String filters (name / archetype / actor value / nif path)
   and Form/EditorID filters, plus the `+` / `-` / `*` / match modifiers and evaluation order. This is
   where "which items" lives.
4. **`references/traits.md`** — section 3: the per-type trait grammar (Armor `AR()`, Weapon animation
   types, Magic Effect `D()`/`CT()`/school, Soul Gem `SOUL()`/`GEM()`, …). Only the 12 trait-bearing
   types have these.
5. **`references/value-tables.md`** — flat lookups: effect archetypes, spell types, schools,
   delivery/casting numbers, soul/furniture/bench sizes, body slots, resistances, actor values.
6. **`references/index.jsonl`** — a grep-friendly router (one JSON entry per line) mapping a topic,
   type, filter, trait, or value to its file. Grep it to jump straight to the right section.

Read grammar-core plus the one or two topic files your task needs — don't bulk-load everything.

## Workflow — compose a KID line

1. **Identify the keyword** — what tag is being added. Reference it by **EditorID** (e.g.
   `WeapMaterialDwarven`) or **FormID** `0x12345~Plugin.esp`. If the EditorID doesn't resolve, KID
   *creates the keyword at runtime* — so a custom tag like `MyCursedGear` is valid and KID makes it
   (`grammar-core.md` §5).

2. **Identify the item type** — *what* gets the keyword. One of the 19 in `types.md` (`Weapon`,
   `Armor`, `Magic Effect`, `Potion`, `Book`, `Soul Gem`, …). Write the type string **exactly** as
   listed. One line targets one type — repeat the line per type to cover several.

3. **Choose the filters** (`filters.md`) — *which* items of that type:
   - by **name / archetype / actor value / nif path** → a **String** filter.
   - by **specific record / plugin / associated form** (e.g. a weapon's enchantment) → a **Form**
     filter (`0x123~Mod.esp`, an EditorID, or a plugin name for all of a mod's items).
   - apply modifiers: `+` requires all, `-` excludes, `*` wildcard-substring (strings only), bare =
     match-any. Evaluate Requirements → Exclusions → Matches → Wildcards.

4. **Add traits if needed** (`traits.md`) — narrow by type-specific properties (`E`/`-E` enchanted,
   `AR(10/50)` armor rating, `OneHandSword`, `20(0/25)` novice destruction, `BLACK` soul gem, …). Only
   the 12 trait-bearing types accept these.

5. **Compose the line** (`grammar-core.md` §4):
   ```
   Keyword = KeywordOrFormID | Type | filters | traits | chance
   ```
   - **Count the pipes** — sections are positional. `Keyword = MyKwd|Book|NONE|S,20` puts `S,20` in
     *traits*; `Keyword = MyKwd|Armor|||50` puts `50` in *chance* with empty filters and traits.
     Leave an unused middle section blank or `NONE`; drop a trailing unused section.
   - Set **chance** (0–100, default 100) only if you want less than guaranteed.

6. **Place the file** at `Data\<name>_KID.ini` — the **`_KID` substring in the filename is mandatory**
   (a file without it is never read), and KID INIs have **no `[Section]` headers** — every line sits at
   the top level. Comment with `;`.

7. **Confirm**: the type matches the record kind; the filter reads the way the user intended; the pipe
   positions are right; trait tokens are valid for that type; and the filename contains `_KID`.

## Bundled-or-warn — never invent KID grammar

The reference documents KID **v3.5.0**, the full published grammar. If a type, filter, trait, value, or
behavior isn't in it, **say so — don't fabricate a plausible token.** KID failures are silent: an
unparseable line or unknown token is logged to `po3_KeywordItemDistributor.log` and skipped, so a
guessed token yields a `_KID.ini` that quietly adds nothing — and nothing in-game points at the cause.
A clear "that isn't in the KID reference" beats a confident wrong line that costs a debugging session.
If the user is on a KID newer than v3.5.0 and asks about a feature not in the reference, surface that
the reference may be behind and offer to re-derive from the current KID source/description.

## Common mistakes

- **Targeting NPCs.** KID adds keywords to **items**. "Add a keyword to all bandits / female Nords" is
  *NPCs* → that's SPID. The keyword going onto an NPC, not an item, is the tell.
- **Miscounting pipe positions.** Sections are positional; a chance written one pipe early lands in
  *traits* and is silently misread. Count the pipes; keep blank middles (`||`) when a later section is
  used.
- **Wrong type string.** Use the exact name from `types.md` (`Magic Effect`, not `MagicEffect`; `Soul
  Gem`, not `Soulgem`). A wrong type string fails to match.
- **Traits on a trait-less type.** Location, Misc Item, Key, Activator, Flora, Race, Talking Activator
  take **no** traits — filter them by name/form only (`types.md`).
- **Confusing the `E` trait with the `Enchantment` type.** `E` filters *items that carry* an
  enchantment; `Enchantment` is the ENCH record type itself.
- **Forgetting `_KID` in the filename**, or adding `[Section]` headers. The `_KID` substring is
  required; KID reads only the unnamed root section.
- **Inventing a trait or value.** Look up the per-type trait list and the value tables — a wrong trait
  token (e.g. a casting-type number that doesn't exist) silently no-ops.

## Notes

- **Provenance.** The `references/` corpus is reconstructed from the MIT KID source
  (`powerof3/Keyword-Item-Distributor`, v3.5.0) and the Nexus #55728 description, with forwarded enum
  values confirmed against `powerof3/CommonLibSSE`. See `references/_CORPUS_STATUS.md`. On a KID version
  bump, re-derive before trusting it for new features.
- **Lookup without authoring.** The same reference answers "what's the spell-type number for Ability",
  "which body slot is 33", or "what archetypes can I filter magic effects by" — open `value-tables.md`;
  no line needs writing.
- **`ExclusiveGroup`.** A second key (`ExclusiveGroup = Name|kwd1,kwd2`) defines mutually-exclusive
  keywords so an item won't receive two from the same group (`grammar-core.md` §7) — source-documented,
  not on the Nexus page.
- **Cross-tool routing.** KID is one of the Skyrim distributor frameworks (KID / SPID / CID) plus the
  record-editor SkyPatcher. When the target is ambiguous, ask what receives the change: an item (KID),
  an NPC (SPID), a container (CID), or a record's own fields (SkyPatcher).
- **Comment syntax** is standard INI `;` (KID reads configs via the CSimpleIniA library).
