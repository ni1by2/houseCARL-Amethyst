description: Work with Skyrim Special Edition load-order records and assets through houseCARL-Amethyst — connect or refresh an Amethyst profile, inspect active or inactive plugins and conflict trees, read records, query across plugins, author reviewable patch ESPs, create or remove records, edit leveled lists and composed structs, diff and resolve, edit NIF meshes and facegen, author dialogue, audit the SkyPatcher and SKSE runtime layers, compact or merge plugins, drive Papyrus compile/decompile and BSA archives, and look mods up on Nexus. Also routes to the bundled Skyrim helper skills. Use whenever the user mentions houseCARL, Amethyst, plugins, load order, conflicts, ESP patches, record types, facegen, dialogue, SKSE, Papyrus, BSA archives, Nexus, or a no-ESP runtime distribution.

# houseCARL

Use this skill for data-layer Skyrim Special Edition modding through houseCARL-Amethyst. It reads the active native Amethyst profile and authoritative filemap, resolves true winners, and writes reviewable patches into Amethyst staging. Original source mods remain untouched unless the user explicitly chooses the guarded in-place lane.

## Core workflow (read before you write)

1. Confirm context when it matters:
   - `housecarl_amethyst_status` for the connected profile, staging roots, deployment state, and pending redeployments.
   - `housecarl_refresh` to re-read Amethyst state immediately; normal tools also refresh lazily.
   - `housecarl_load_order_status` for profile/plugin status, or to check whether a mod or plugin is active.
   - `housecarl_set_amethyst_connection` when the user gives a schema-v1 Amethyst connection manifest.
2. Read before any record write:
   - `mutagen-reference` to verify field names, writability, enum values, and composed-struct shapes.
   - `housecarl_read_record` or `housecarl_batch_record_detail` to inspect the current winner. Add `conflict_tree=true` for contested records or when winner provenance matters.
   - `housecarl_cross_plugin_query` to locate records or references across the load order (page big results with `offset=`).
3. Pick the narrowest write tool:
   - `housecarl_set_field` for a single scalar or simple-collection edit.
   - `housecarl_bulk_apply` for several edits in one patch, dict merges, leveled-list entries, effects, or other composed structs.
   - `housecarl_create_record` (or `housecarl_bulk_create` for many at once) for a new top-level record — it needs an EditorID.
   - `housecarl_remove_record` only to drop a record or override from a houseCARL-owned patch — never from a source mod.
4. Accumulate related edits into one patch with `into=<patch filename>` after the first write returns a patch name.
5. Prefer runtime, no-ESP INI systems when they fit the user's intent — `skypatcher-authoring`, `spid-authoring`, `kid-authoring` (see the helper skills below).

## The full tool surface

Beyond the core workflow, reach for the right group. Depth for the specialist areas lives in the helper skills (next section) — load the skill before composing in that area.

**Read / query / resolve**
- `housecarl_read_record`, `housecarl_batch_record_detail` — read one or many records at the true winner (`conflict_tree=true` for provenance).
- `housecarl_read_plugin_file` — read a plugin directly, even one that is disabled or not active.
- `housecarl_cross_plugin_query` — query and filter records or references across the whole order; page with `offset=`, count with `group_by=`.
- `housecarl_resolve` — resolve a list of FormIDs to identity; `housecarl_diff_record` — diff two plugins' versions of a record.
- `housecarl_effect_chain` — trace a magic effect to every spell / enchantment / potion / scroll / ingredient that carries it.
- `housecarl_load_order_status` — enabled/disabled mods & plugins; `housecarl_check_errors` — dangling refs, missing masters, broken links.

**Runtime layers (what xEdit can't see)**
- `housecarl_skypatcher_read` — a record's true state after the SkyPatcher INI layer replays; `housecarl_skypatcher_layer` — the INIs, apply order, conflicts.
- `housecarl_skse_inventory` — SKSE-plugin DLLs, configs, provider/metadata; `housecarl_skse_config_audit` — config references vs the load order; `housecarl_native_pairing_audit` — native Papyrus declarations vs the DLLs implementing them.

**Write / author**
- `housecarl_set_field`, `housecarl_bulk_apply`, `housecarl_create_record`, `housecarl_bulk_create`, `housecarl_create_plugin` (header-only trigger plugin), `housecarl_remove_record`, `housecarl_forward_record` (copy-as-override, or revert to another plugin's version), `housecarl_validate_scripts` (unbound script properties).

**Dialogue** — `housecarl_validate_dialogue`, `housecarl_write_seq` (the start-game-enabled quest `.seq`). Depth: `dialogue-authoring`.

**Assets / NIF / facegen** — `housecarl_asset_status` (which staged file/BSA wins a Data-relative path), `housecarl_place_asset` / `housecarl_bulk_place_asset` (stage a chosen winning override), `housecarl_nif_inspect` / `housecarl_nif_set` (read/write mesh data values). Depth: `facegen-diagnostics`.

**Plugin operations** — `housecarl_compact_plugin` (ESL-renumber, carries FormID-keyed facegen/voice along), `housecarl_merge_plugins`, `housecarl_copy_npc_appearance` (standalone appearance, no donor master).

**Papyrus / SKSE code** — `housecarl_compile_script` (`.psc` → `.pex`), `housecarl_decompile_script` (`.pex` → `.psc`). Depth: `papyrus-reference`, `papyrus-optimization`, `skse-plugin-authoring`.

**BSA archives** — `housecarl_bsa_list`, `housecarl_bsa_extract`, `housecarl_bsa_repack`.

**Nexus (keyless, no browser)** — `housecarl_nexus_search`, `housecarl_nexus_mod`, `housecarl_nexus_check_updates`, `housecarl_nexus_identify`, `housecarl_nexus_graphql`. For a whole-order update check, start with `housecarl_update_status` (local staging metadata, no network), then confirm with `housecarl_nexus_check_updates`.

**Setup** — `housecarl_set_amethyst_connection`, `housecarl_amethyst_status`, `housecarl_refresh`, and `housecarl_set_tool_path` for deferred external tools or log folders.

## Bundled helper skills

Load the specialist skill before composing in its domain:

- **Reference** — `mutagen-reference` (record schemas), `papyrus-reference` (Papyrus / SKSE function signatures), `biped-slot-reference` (armor by biped slot).
- **Runtime distribution grammars** — `skypatcher-authoring` (record edits), `spid-authoring` (spells / perks / items / factions / outfits → NPCs), `kid-authoring` (keywords → items).
- **Content authoring / investigation** — `dialogue-authoring`, `facegen-diagnostics` (the dark-face NPC bug), `oar-authoring` (Open Animation Replacer), `skse-plugin-authoring` (C++ SKSE plugin DLLs).
- **Performance & guardrail** — `papyrus-optimization` (script cost review), `tool-output-awareness` (keep generated tool output out of authored patches).
- **Bulk planning** — `bulk-record-jobs` (catalogues, audits, link graphs, conflict surveys, fan-out extraction — many records into one structured deliverable).

## FormID notes

houseCARL tools use `XXXXXX:Plugin.esp` FormIDs — six hex digits, then the filename of the master that defines the record. SkyPatcher, SPID, and KID each use their own FormID syntax; consult their skills before writing INI lines.

## Safety notes

- houseCARL patches are reviewable output mods. Tell the user which patch was created or extended.
- A staged write is not game-visible until Amethyst refreshes, enables the generated mod when needed, rebuilds the filemap, and deploys.
- Don't invent schemas or field paths. If `mutagen-reference` has no entry for a type, say so directly rather than guessing.
- Don't reach for record edits when the user explicitly wants a no-ESP / runtime distribution file — use SkyPatcher, SPID, or KID instead.
- Never edit a source mod in place unless the user has explicitly opted in, completed the consent handshake, and confirmed the required Amethyst redeployment.
