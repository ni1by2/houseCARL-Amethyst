# Changelog

All notable changes to houseCARL are documented here. Versioning is [semantic](https://semver.org);
the `version` in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` is bumped on each release, so installed users update only
when it changes.

## Unreleased

*Accumulating notes for the next cut — not yet released; `plugin.json` still reads the last shipped version.*

**A plugin addressed by its file path is no longer mislabeled off-order and disabled (#269).**
`diff_record` stamped `OUT-OF-LOAD-ORDER (direct path, disabled)` on a plugin that is enabled and winning whenever it
was passed as an absolute path instead of a filename — the diff values were right, but the provenance line said the
live file wasn't live, which is exactly the claim a diff is consulted for. Two causes, both fixed: the shared on-disk
locate asserted "not enabled" for every direct path instead of computing it, and `diff_record` routed poles by plugin
NAME only, so a path could never match the active order. Enabled-ness now comes from the same enumerator the filename
lane uses (so the two can't disagree about one file), and a path that IS the copy the order loads resolves back to its
plugin name and diffs as `active order`.

The flag a located plugin carries — what `read_plugin_file` renders as `NOT active` and `diff_record` as `disabled` —
now means one thing in every lane: **the game loads this file**. That needs both halves, and each was wrong before:

- **The right copy.** Judged by full path against the copy the install actually serves (the first hit from an enabled
  layer — the same rule that builds the real load order). An archived backup sharing a filename stays
  `OUT-OF-LOAD-ORDER`, so the old-version-vs-live diff is unchanged; a copy shadowed by a higher-priority mod is not
  called active merely because its own mod is enabled; and a plugin served from game `Data` is not called inactive
  merely because some disabled mod holds the same filename.
- **Ticked.** A plugin sitting in an *enabled mod* but *unchecked in MO2's right pane* is no longer reported as
  active — the game does not load it. Implicit base/CC masters, which are force-loaded and never listed in
  `plugins.txt`, still count as active. This half applies to the filename and `mod=` lanes too, so all three now
  state the same fact.

Reported by a houseCARL user. (The banner wording and the one-flag-many-causes question this left open are resolved by
the next entry.)

**Every "not active" now says WHY, and so does every refusal that turns one away (#271).**
`NOT active` / `disabled` named the state but never the cause — and the causes have different fixes: the plugin is
unticked in `plugins.txt`, its mod is switched off, a higher-priority mod shadows this copy, or MO2 has not registered
it. Reading `[mod 'X' (enabled); NOT active]`, you could not tell which, so the answer had to be rediscovered by hand
every time. Two things changed:

- **The located-plugin flag became two facts** — *is this the copy the install serves* and *is this plugin ticked* —
  carried separately so each renderer can explain rather than classify. `read_plugin_file`, `diff_record`'s off-order
  pole, and `copy_npc_appearance`'s donor line now state the cause, from one shared composer so they cannot drift
  apart; the JSON lane gains a `why_not_active` field beside `enabled`. A file the game *does* load now says so
  positively instead of saying nothing. Vocabulary is consistent throughout: a **mod** is enabled/disabled, a
  **plugin** is active/inactive — `diff_record` no longer calls an unticked plugin "disabled".
- **Refusals explain themselves.** A tool that reads *through* the load order still refuses on a plugin the game does
  not load — that guard is the point — but instead of a flat "not in the load order", it now says the plugin is
  installed and unticked (or that its mod is off), and points at `read_plugin_file` for a raw read. This covers
  `read_record`, `check_errors`, `validate_scripts`, `merge_plugins`, every in-place write target, and the forward
  source check. A genuine typo still gets its "did you mean" — the explanation replaces the spelling guess only when
  there is a real cause to state. The four not-loaded causes each carry their own remedy, and the two that look
  alike from outside — a mod switched **off** versus a folder MO2 has **never registered** (where there is nothing
  to switch on) — are told apart from MO2's own mod list rather than guessed.

**The `read_plugin_file` banner no longer overclaims.** It read `OUT-OF-LOAD-ORDER (raw file read; the game does not
load this file)` — true of the read, false about the file whenever the one you passed IS the live plugin. It now reads
`(raw file read — not resolved through the load order)`, which holds in every case; what the game does with the file
is stated separately, per file, with its reason. The same sentence is gone from `read_plugin_file`'s own tool
description and from `copy_npc_appearance`'s donor line, where it was asserted even for a donor the game does load.

**The Codex umbrella router now covers the whole tool surface, and a CI guard keeps it that way (Codex parity).**
The Codex packaging ships one umbrella routing skill (`plugin/codex/housecarl/SKILL.md`); it had drifted to naming
only 9 of the ~45 MCP tools and 5 of the 13 helper skills, so a Codex user asking about facegen, Nexus, BSA
archives, dialogue, SKSE audits, or plugin compaction got no routing from it. It now carries a capability-grouped
map of **all 45 tools** and routes to **all 13 helper skills** (the discrete skills themselves already install to
Codex under `~/.agents/skills/`, so this restores the router, not the skills). A new `codex-umbrella-coverage`
CI guard reflects the real `[McpServerTool]` names and the `.claude/skills/*` folders and fails if any is unrouted
by the umbrella (or explicitly allow-listed) — so the drift cannot silently recur: adding a tool or skill without
updating the Codex router turns CI red. Codex packaging + CI only; no change to Claude Code behavior.

**The `bulk-record-jobs` skill now teaches how to get a big enumeration out — paging vs. persist-to-file (#249).**
A new section distinguishes the two independent caps a bulk read hits — the row cap (`limit=` → `capped`) and the
per-call output cap (`max_chars` → `truncated`) — and names the two lanes for clearing them: `offset=` paging on
`cross_plugin_query` (deterministic tiling windows; the primary lane, previously undocumented in the skill) and, as the
complement, raising `max_chars` so an oversized result **persists to a file** to post-process with scripts instead of
reading it into context (the move that made a 7,479-NPC facegen sweep single-session — one call per plugin, a 5,118-row
JSON document). Both come with the mandatory guardrail (verify `truncated == false` and `rendered == total` in the
persisted file) and a caution that huge tool *inputs* are their own stall risk (batch to a few hundred per call).
Skill documentation only; no tool behavior changed.

**The 13 bundled skills' descriptions were trimmed to cut always-loaded startup context (#256).**
A skill's `name` + `description` frontmatter load into every session's context — they are not Tool-Search-deferrable —
and the 13 descriptions totalled ~3,650 tokens. Each carried, past its trigger surface, a trailing
"Load this before X — <counter-intuitive mechanics>" rationale and grammar detail that is already spelled out in full
in the skill body (lazy-loaded, free at rest). Those tails and the "using the bundled reference rather than invented
syntax" boilerplate were trimmed while **every "Use when…" trigger cue and every not-this-other-skill disambiguation
line was kept**, so trigger accuracy is unchanged and ~590 tokens (16%) come off the always-resident cost. Descriptions
only — no skill body, reference, or behavior changed; every trimmed frontmatter still parses (the `plugin-validate`
CI guard, which exists because a colon-space once silently dropped a whole skill, stays green).

**houseCARL's MCP server instructions now orient tool discovery across the whole surface, not just Nexus (#257).**
The server's `initialize` `instructions` blurb — always resident in the agent's context — was ~90% a Nexus how-to that
duplicated each Nexus tool's own description and named none of houseCARL's core capabilities, so an agent relying on
Tool Search had nothing telling it houseCARL could read inactive plugins, see through the SKSE/SkyPatcher runtime
layers, author dialogue, or compact/merge/decompile. It now leads with the data-layer / MO2 domain and an explicit
"reach for these tools when…" cue, then sweeps the real surface in five groups (read/query, write, fix,
reshape/drive-tools, Nexus). Per-tool parameter detail was dropped from the blurb — each tool carries its own,
fetched on demand — leaving the string broader yet slightly leaner (1,902 bytes, within the ~2 KB per-server budget)
and ordered so any truncation loses only the least load-bearing Nexus tail.

**`housecarl_nif_inspect` `sections=` now accepts the JSON-array form and fails loud on an all-unrecognized value (#247).**
Passing `sections` as a JSON array — the natural MCP way to send a list — arrived as the literal string
`["shapes","paths"]`, and, split only on comma/space, tokenized to `["shapes` / `"paths"]` (brackets and quotes glued
on), read as unrecognized, and the tool **quietly fell back to rendering the default summary** — so a batch could run
with the wrong sections while the warning scrolled off the top of a large persisted file. The tokenizer now treats
bracket and quote as delimiters too, so `["shapes","paths"]` parses; and a `sections=` in which **nothing** is
recognized is now a loud error naming the tokens, never a silent summary (a partial request still renders the valid
sections plus a warning). The unrecognized-section message — and the tool description — now also point out there is no
`textures` section: a mesh's embedded texture-set slot paths appear under `shapes` (per-shape detail) and `paths`.

**`housecarl_bulk_apply` read-back now reports the true count for a `composes=` Add of N — no more misleading `(+1)` (#259).**
Appending N elements to a list field in one op via `composes=` rendered a verify line that reported only the last element,
as if a single element was added — `✓ … Add Conditions: now 37 (+1), new [36] = [ConditionFloat]` for a six-element
compose — because the Add read-back hardcoded a `+1` delta and the single last index. The data on disk was correct (the
list total was the only clue all six landed), but the summary contradicted the op and cost real mid-session doubt. The
read-back now carries the op's appended count and reports the whole run: `now 37 (+6), new [31..36]`. A single-element
Add is unchanged (`now 29 (+1), new [28] = …`).

**A `[Flags]` enum field with unknown bits now decodes the known bits instead of collapsing to a bare decimal (#255).**
When a flags field carries a bit the record catalog doesn't name (a modded slot, or a game-version bit houseCARL's
Mutagen build predates), `.NET`'s `[Flags].ToString()` abandons the name list and renders the whole value as one
decimal — e.g. `Configuration.Flags = 2490402` on Dawnguard vampire NPCs — silently losing even the *known* bits
(gender, uniqueness, ghost state) a consumer needs. A read now appends a display-only decode of the form
`2490402   (<known flag names> (+unknown bits 0x…))` — the known bits by name, the unnamed remainder as an explicit hex
mask, so the common bits stay directly consumable and the presence of unknown bits is stated rather than hidden. The
known bits are peeled the way `[Flags].ToString()` itself names them (fully-contained members, combos before their
constituent bits), so the name slot is never itself a bare decimal. The round-trip token is unchanged (the bare decimal
still round-trips through `Enum.Parse`, so write / read-proof / diff are untouched) — the decode rides the same display
channel as the existing biped-slot annotation, which keeps its slot-number decode.

**`housecarl_read_record` / `housecarl_batch_record_detail` `depth=2` now surfaces an owned-record list element's own FormID (#252).**
A list whose elements are themselves owned records — most commonly a DIAL topic's `Responses` (each element an INFO record) —
surfaced no FormID at `depth=2`: an element rendered a bare `[DialogResponses]` (or `[DialogResponses] EditorID=…` when the INFO
carried an EditorID), never the FormKey that is an owned record's canonical identity. Mapping topics to their child INFOs meant a
second call with explicit `[i].FormKey` paths (and you couldn't enumerate those paths without first reading the element count).
The `depth=2` "index + identity" contract now holds for owned-record elements the way it already did for lone-FormLink structs
(#198): each leads with `[DialogResponses 000ABC:Plugin.esp editorid=…]` — its own FormKey, plus EditorID when present. Applies
wherever `depth=` expands (text and `format=json`).

**`Conditions[].Data` arm parameters now expand in a `Conditions` list dump (#258).** A polymorphic condition-data arm reached by
expanding a `Conditions` list stopped at its bare `[GetFactionRankConditionData]` type — its parameter fields (`Faction`, `Global`,
`Reference`, `RunOnType`, …) surfaced only when `Data` was addressed directly (`fields=["Conditions[2].Data"]`) or at an extra depth
level, so a `fields=["Conditions"] depth=3` dump silently stopped one level short of the params. The depth-floor "open one bounded
level" exception — previously VMAD-script-property-only — now also opens a condition arm's parameters, so a whole condition stack
(function + params) reads in one call at the natural depth. Bounded to one level (an arm's members are leaves/links) and
type-targeted (every other substruct still stops at the floor, unchanged).

**`housecarl_cross_plugin_query` `group_by=` now case-folds plugin keys — case-variant spellings of one plugin no
longer split into separate groups (#248).** A load-order-wide `group_by=defined_in` counted the same plugin twice when
different plugins spelled a shared master with different casing — e.g. `ccBGSSSE025-AdvDSGS.esm = 40` *and*
`ccbgssse025-advdsgs.esm = 35` as two rows — because a defining-plugin key carries each plugin's own master-list
spelling. Any consumer summing per-plugin counts silently double-grouped. Plugin filenames are case-insensitive
identifiers everywhere else in houseCARL (and in the game); group keys now match, merging the counts (first-seen casing
is displayed). The same case-fold covers `group_by=winner` for consistency (its keys come from one canonical name array,
so they don't vary in casing the way `defined_in` keys do); `group_by=type` is unaffected (record-type names never
differ only by case).

**`housecarl_cross_plugin_query` gains `where_source=winner` — filter on the live winner, not the scoped body (#233).**
Under a `plugins=` scope the body filters (`where=`, `references=`, `editorid_contains=`) decided the match against
each match's *scoped* plugin body, even with `winner_fields=true` — so a post-patch audit like "Bruma-defined NPCs
whose live winner still uses a PC-level multiplier" returned every record that *ever* had one (259), not the 82 whose
winner *still* does. `winner_fields=` only changed what was *displayed*, never what *matched*. Now `where_source=winner`
retargets the whole match onto the live load-order winner: `plugins=[…] defined_in=true where=["Configuration.Level.LevelMult >= 0"]
where_source=winner` returns exactly the winners still on the multiplier, server-side, in one call — no more scanning every
winner in the order and filtering FormKeys by hand. (It re-fetches each candidate's winner body, so a very *broad*
winner-source scan is not yet as fast as it can be — an O(order) fetch is tracked in #251; correctness is unaffected.)
It stays decoupled
from `winner_fields=` (DISPLAY), so `where_source=winner winner_fields=false` matches on the winner while showing the
scoped origin body — a real audit. Loud refusals (Q3): an unknown value names `scoped`/`winner`; `where_source=winner`
with no body filter to retarget is refused; and under a `type=`-only scope (already the winner) it's accepted with a
"redundant" note, never a silent no-op. Default (`scoped`) is unchanged.

**`housecarl_cross_plugin_query` learns `depth=` (#231).** Nested list contents were unreachable in a scan:
`fields=["Effects"]` rendered only `[list: N item(s)]`, and the workaround — hand-written bracket paths like
`Effects[2].Data.Magnitude` — meant guessing the longest list up front and eating an out-of-bounds error triple
for every shorter record (66 spells → hundreds of wasted lines, twice past the token cap). Now `depth=` rides the
scan with the same semantics as `housecarl_read_record` / `batch_record_detail`: `fields=["Effects"], depth=4`
expands every match's per-effect Data in one call — each record shows exactly its OWN elements, no index guessing,
no out-of-bounds noise — and `resolve_names=` composes with the expansion. Works in `format=text` and `json`;
`dense` refuses `depth>1` loud (its columnar cells align 1:1 with the requested paths — the container cells name
the text/json hop), and `depth=` without `fields=` is refused loud too. The old container hint ("cross_plugin_query
has no depth=; expand via batch_record_detail") is retired with the gap it described.

**`housecarl_nif_inspect` goes batch — `mesh_paths` takes one or many (#229).** The last per-file loop in a
load-order-wide dark-face scan is gone: `mesh_path` is now `mesh_paths`, an `asset_status`-style array (a single
path is simply a batch of one). One call resolves the whole flagged subset — **one load-order resolution for the
entire batch** instead of one per mesh — with results in input order, `sections=` / `mod=` / `max_chars` applying
batch-wide, and every per-path failure (ABSENT, bad path, a `mod=` that doesn't provide it, unreadable bytes, a
parse refusal) reported LOUD on **that** path without aborting the rest (Q3). The batch-level caveats (unreadable
archives, discovery warnings) render once, first, so a long batch can't truncate them away — and every ABSENT is
additionally **hedged at point of use** when the scan behind it was incomplete (`asset_status` parity: a bare
"absent" is never over-trusted just because the top-of-output alarm scrolled away). An over-cap output is cut with
the omitted-mesh count named, never silently — and `max_chars` can never starve a single-path call of its core
answer (the first mesh's resolution/error always renders). The `facegen-diagnostics` batch flow no longer needs to
sample the flagged subset — inspect all of it in one call.

**`resolve_names` / `housecarl_resolve` no longer call PlayerRef "unresolved" (#230).** The engine-implicit forms —
PlayerRef (`000014:Skyrim.esm`) and the Player base NPC (`000007:Skyrim.esm`) — are hardcoded engine references no
plugin defines, so the identity resolver flagged every condition or link pointing at them as
`unresolved: target not in the active order` (67 false suspects in one 67-record audit), while `check_errors`
correctly called the same links clean. The resolver now applies the same precise two-form exemption the integrity
sweep and dialogue lints already share: those links annotate `→ PlayerRef` / `→ Player` (winner `<engine>` in a
`housecarl_resolve` row), and any OTHER sub-0x800 form still reports unresolved — the exemption is the two known
forms, never the whole reserved range.

**`housecarl_bulk_apply` learns manifest files — `from_file=` (#224).** A big write job used to mean pasting the
whole ops array inline (the 745-record stress test generated 20 local `ops_*.json` chunk files and fed them through
piecewise). Now `from_file=<absolute path>` reads the SAME operations array as a JSON manifest on disk: generate
the manifest once, validate the **whole file** with `dry_run=true` before the first write, apply it in one call —
and re-run the same manifest to recover an interrupted write (overrides are idempotent). The parsed ops ride the
identical pipeline as inline ones (every lane and `dry_run` compose by construction; the dry-run report is
string-identical to the same ops inline). The file contract is all named refusals (Q3): `operations` XOR
`from_file`, absolute path required, invalid JSON named with line+column, a non-array root, an empty array, and —
stricter than inline binding, which silently drops unknown members — a misspelled op member (`feild_path`) is
refused **by name at its element** instead of becoming a null-field op whose downstream error points away from the
typo.

**Dry-run mode for the write tools (#225).** `housecarl_set_field`, `housecarl_bulk_apply`, and
`housecarl_forward_record` gain `dry_run=true`: the **full real write pipeline** runs — winner resolve, schema
pre-flight, every op applied to the in-memory would-be plugin, a reference-resolution check that pre-empts the
serialize's missing-master failure — and stops at the point of no return, so **nothing touches disk** (no patch
file, no mod folder, no in-place rewrite). The report says what *would* change (per-op would-be values, the
expected master set, `full_readback=true` for the full in-memory record preview), and a bad batch gets **exactly
the all-or-nothing refusal the real call would give** — so a wrong field path in a 700-op batch is caught before
the first write, not diagnosed after the last. Works on every lane: fresh patch, `into=`, and `in_place` (an
in-place dry run needs no `acknowledge` and never records consent — it's read-only; the pending consent is noted
so the real write's one-time prompt isn't a surprise).

**BSA reads move in-process — `housecarl_bsa_list` / `housecarl_bsa_extract` (#217).** Listing and extracting a
`.bsa` no longer shell out to BSArch; they read through Mutagen's own in-process BSA reader. This fixes an archive
class BSArch's *unpacker* rejected: an archive written by a non-BSArch tool could list and load in-game yet extract
to **zero files**. It also now handles **compressed** archives, and was verified byte-for-byte identical to BSArch's
own unpack (uncompressed *and* compressed). Consequences:

- **No external tool is needed to list or extract** — only `housecarl_bsa_repack` still calls BSArch, because Mutagen
  ships a BSA reader but no writer (confirmed by exhaustive reflection over its archive surface). Repack is now the
  one BSA operation that still prompts for the BSArch path.
- Extraction gains two safety properties the BSArch path never had: it is **path-traversal-guarded** (an entry
  resolving outside the destination is refused) and **content-aware/idempotent** (a byte-identical file already
  present is skipped).
- A per-entry size ceiling and a header-vs-reader file-count cross-check keep a corrupt or hostile archive to a
  **loud, named failure** rather than an out-of-memory or a silent empty extract.

**Wrong-type arguments are now named (#222).** Passing an argument of the wrong type — an object where a number
is expected, a string where a boolean is — used to surface as a raw `JsonException … BytePositionInLine: 34`: a
byte offset with no parameter name, forcing you to bisect which argument was at fault. The argument-binding shim
now catches the type mismatch *before* binding and names the offender, its expected type, and the kind received
(e.g. `parameter whose type could not be bound: conflicts_only (expects boolean, received string)`) — the same
named-and-actionable style the missing-parameter and unknown-parameter paths already use. Obvious-intent shapes
(a bare string for an array, a quoted number or boolean) are still auto-coerced, so well-formed calls are
unaffected.

**Obvious parameter aliases now bind (#221).** Tool parameters aren't uniformly named — one tool takes `plugins`,
another `plugin`, another `plugin_name` — so a first-guess miss (`form_id` for `formid`, `plugin` for a tool's
`plugins`) cost a round-trip. The argument-binding shim now recognizes an obvious synonym of a declared parameter
and renames it to the canonical one, so the call binds instead of erroring. It's deliberately conservative: it
resolves an underscore/case variant (`form_id` ≡ `formid`) or a known singular/plural synonym, and **only** when
exactly one declared, not-already-supplied parameter matches — an ambiguous or unmatched name still gets the named
unknown-parameter error, a declared parameter is never treated as an alias (a tool's real `plugin=` is untouched),
and an explicit canonical value is never overwritten. The published schema still advertises only the canonical
name.

**`cross_plugin_query` learns identity membership — `formid in` / `formid not in` a supplied list (#226).** The
reconciliation subtraction — "every record of these types in plugin X, *minus* these ~1,200 already-claimed
FormIDs" — used to run client-side over verbose enumerations because `where=` had no exclusion predicate. It now
does: `where=["formid not in [XXXXXX:A.esp, YYYYYY:B.esp]"]` (inline, comma-separated — spaces in plugin
filenames are safe, and a pasted JSON array works as-is) or `where=["formid not in @C:\\work\\claimed.txt"]` (an
absolute-path file of FormIDs, comma- or newline-separated). `formid in` is the symmetric keep-only form, and both
AND with the existing value predicates. The list is fully validated before any scan — a malformed FormID, an
unreadable or relative file path, or an empty list refuses the call by name, never a silent wrong result.

**`cross_plugin_query` learns bulk-enumeration economy — `format="dense"` + `offset=` pagination (#223).** A
whole-mod enumeration used to be the context-budget drain: `format="json"` repeated the identity envelope and a
`{path, value}` object per field on every match (~80 records per 40k chars at two fields), and with `limit` but no
offset, paging meant slicing by `editorid_contains`. Now:

- **`format="dense"`** renders one columnar document — a `columns` array once, then one positional row per match
  (`[formid, editorid, field values…]`; summary rows are `[formid, type, editorid, winner, override_depth]`; under
  a `plugins=` scope, detail rows gain a `source` column naming the body each row's values came from). Same
  read path and accounting as the other formats; a no-value field shows its note (`"(absent)"`) in-cell, a failed
  row lands in a separate `errors` array, and `resolve_names` annotations still work. In the probe's own
  measurement the same one-field query renders **2.6× smaller** than `format="json"` — and the gap widens with
  more fields.
- **`offset=`** skips the first N matches, so `offset=0/500/1000…` + `limit=` pages an enumeration in windows that
  tile exactly (scan order is deterministic while the load order is unchanged). The true total always counts all
  matches; the text header names the window and the next offset (`showing matches 501–1000; continue with
  offset=1000`), and json/dense carry `offset` in-band. Negative offsets and `offset=` under `group_by=` (a count
  table has no window) are refused by name.

## 1.9.0 — 2026-07-17

houseCARL's view of the **SKSE-plugin layer** grows from *inventory* into *diagnosis*: two new audit tools
that catch a broken native pairing or a dead config reference statically — before the game fails silently on
it — completing the SKSE layer-visibility ladder (tiers A→D, #199). **Two new tools (→ 45), no new skills
(still 13).**

**SKSE layer diagnosis — two new audit tools**

- **`housecarl_native_pairing_audit` — the native functions your scripts declare vs the DLLs that must
  implement them.** A native Papyrus function is one thing declared in two files that ship and fail
  independently: a `.pex` class flags the function, and an SKSE DLL registers the implementation at runtime.
  When the halves don't meet, the engine logs a cryptic "unable to bind" and the calls silently no-op. This
  scans the winning copy of every compiled script (loose + BSA) and pairs each native-declaring class to the
  DLLs its mod ships under `SKSE\Plugins`, leading with the findings: **PAIRED-BUT-DEAD** — scripts installed,
  but every candidate DLL statically will not load (wrong game runtime for a version-locked plugin, BSA-only,
  shipped in a subfolder, 32-bit, unreadable, or built against the debug CRT) — and **UNPAIRED** — no DLL in
  sight, a VERIFY flag, typically a declaration copy of a framework you don't have. It keeps the engine
  baseline honest by construction (a class carried by an official archive is the engine's, even when an SKSE
  loose override wins the file), and answers "is the pairing plausible and healthy", never "does the DLL
  register exactly these functions" — runtime behaviour, the honest tier-E ceiling it never crosses.
- **`housecarl_skse_config_audit` — the form references your SKSE configs declare vs your real load order.**
  Reads the winning copy of every `.ini` / `.toml` / `.json` / `.yaml` config across the full depth of
  `Data\SKSE\Plugins`, extracts every form-shaped reference (a hex FormID paired with a plugin name in either
  order — the DSD/po3, SkyPatcher, and tilde forms — plus plugin-named folder gates), and resolves each to a
  verdict: **OK**, **PLUGIN MISSING**, **DANGLING** (plugin present but no such record), or **UNPARSEABLE**.
  The summary separates **BROKEN** (dangling / unparseable — actionable) from **INERT** (a plugin you don't
  have installed — usually optional support), so a genuinely broken patch is caught by houseCARL instead of by
  a silent in-game failure. Framework-agnostic: it checks reference *validity*, never what a reference is
  *for* (that's per-framework skill territory) or what the DLL *does* with it (the honest ceiling).

**Enhancement**

- **`housecarl_skse_inventory` gains `peek=` — a static peek inside a specific DLL's image.** With `filter=`
  naming a DLL, `peek=true` reports the DLL's imports and the config paths and plugin names it embeds —
  answering "what does this unfamiliar DLL touch" without loading it. Per-DLL by design (a whole-layer peek
  would read every image and drown signal in noise), so a bare `peek=true` fails loud asking for a filter.

**Fixes**

- **`check_errors` no longer false-flags a faction owner's required rank as a dangling reference.** A record
  owned by a faction at a required rank was misread as carrying a broken link; the rank is a valid part of the
  ownership structure, not a form reference, and is now recognized. (#207)
- **`bulk_create` / `create_record` now fill a dialogue branch's `Flags` (DNAM).** Mutagen omits a null
  optional subrecord, and the engine reads an absent DNAM as **top-level** — so a `DialogBranch` you never
  marked top-level was silently published to the player's dialogue menu: byte-valid, passing every check, wrong
  only once the game loaded it. The CK-parity auto-fill now seeds `Flags` (matching how it already handles
  `Category`), surfaced as an explicit op, and `validate_dialogue` warns when a branch carries no DNAM. (#212)

## 1.8.1 — 2026-07-16

A small read/query-surface patch: two refinements that let a whole-plugin audit and a record read land the
answer in one call instead of a workaround. No new tools or skills (still 43 tools / 13 skills).

- **`cross_plugin_query where=` gains `exists` / `missing` — presence filtering on whole fields.** The value
  operators (`=`, `>=`, `contains`, the bitwise `has`, …) test a *scalar* leaf, so "which records actually
  CARRY a script adapter / an effects list / conditions" meant a sweep-then-filter, one call per record
  type. `where=["VirtualMachineAdapter exists"]` now returns exactly the records that carry that field, and
  `missing` is its complement. "Present" means present **and non-empty** — a non-null substruct or a list
  with at least one element — so an empty list reads as absent, not carried. A mistyped field still fails
  loud, never a silent "0 matches". (#197)
- **A struct's lone FormLink now renders as its identity at `depth=2`.** Reading an NPC's `Perks` at depth 2
  showed each entry as a bare `[PerkPlacement]` with no perk FormID, so the links read as "not surfaced".
  Any struct that has no name-like identity but exactly one FormLink now surfaces it —
  `Perks[0] = [PerkPlacement] Perk=03AF81:Skyrim.esm` — matching what script properties already do with
  `Name=`. Two or more links stay opaque (ambiguous — not guessed). (#198)

## 1.8.0 — 2026-07-15

houseCARL gains two capability layers at once: a **keyless Nexus update-checking** stack — know which of
your installed files are actually out of date, at the exact-file level, trace a file to its mod by hash,
with a raw GraphQL backstop under it — and a **bulk / fleet data surface** — resolve many FormIDs to
identity, diff two plugins' versions of a record, and a batch of aggregation flags on the query, write, and
read surfaces, fronted by a new planning skill. **Six new tools (→ 43) and one new skill (→ 13).**

**Nexus update checking — four new tools and a wider `nexus_mod`**

- **`housecarl_update_status` — read MO2's own update cache, with no network.** MO2 already records, per
  mod, the newest file it last saw on Nexus; this reads that local cache (each mod's `meta.ini`) and reports
  every installed mod whose cached "newest" differs from what's installed — narrowing a whole-order update
  pass to just the candidates before a single network call — and prints each mod's `id#fileid` verify token
  for the live check below. It reports a *difference to verify*, never an asserted "a newer version exists"
  (the cache can lag or lead), and sets the mods with no fileid (FOMOD / manual installs) aside as their own
  manual-verify bucket instead of folding them into "fine".
- **`housecarl_nexus_check_updates` — batch, file-level "is this the current file?".** Pass each mod as
  `id#fileid` and it tells CURRENT from OUTDATED for the **exact file you installed**, not the mod's newest
  MAIN file — the distinction that matters on a multi-file page, where an old-version compatibility patch and
  the current main file share one mod id and a mod-level version compare lies. It resolves manager-only
  (`nxm`, "author disabled direct download") mods that the Nexus search collection excludes — reading them
  through their file data rather than stamping them "not found" — and calls out a genuinely hidden / deleted
  page, and an installed file that's since been pulled, as their own distinct, loud outcomes.
- **`housecarl_nexus_identify` — trace a file to its mod by MD5 hash.** Give it one or more file MD5 hashes
  (the fingerprint a mod manager matches an unknown download by) and it names the source mod, file, and
  version straight from Nexus — keyless — for a file whose origin you've lost.
- **`housecarl_nexus_graphql` — raw, read-only query over the keyless GraphQL.** The completeness backstop
  beneath the curated Nexus tools: when you need a field they don't surface yet (a mod's page tags, say),
  this passes a read-only query through the same public keyless API, so nothing on Nexus is permanently out
  of reach. Prefer the curated tools; this is the escape hatch, not the front door.
- **`housecarl_nexus_mod` reads more of a page.** `files=true` lists every uploaded file; `changelog=true`
  (with an optional `since=`) returns the per-version changelog and the delta between your version and the
  latest; and a mod's page tags now come through — so "what changed since my version, and what kind of mod
  is this?" is answered without a browser. All Nexus traffic now identifies houseCARL by name and version,
  per Nexus's Acceptable Use Policy.

**Bulk / fleet data surface — two new tools, plus query, write, and read flags**

The tool surface was shaped for one record at a time; heavy fan-out runs used it as a bulk data API and had
to improvise the aggregation themselves. This wave adds that aggregation as type-agnostic primitives —
coverage still inherited from the reflection layer, so there are no per-record-type tools.

- **`housecarl_resolve` — many FormIDs → identity, in one call.** Hand it a list of FormIDs and it returns
  each one's record type, EditorID, display name, and load-order winner, with a malformed entry isolated as
  its own per-item error instead of failing the batch. The bulk answer to "what *are* all these forms?".
- **`housecarl_diff_record` — a field-level diff between two plugins' versions of a record.** Point it at a
  FormID and two plugins (`plugin_a` vs `plugin_b`) and it returns only what differs between their two
  versions — either pole active in the load order or read off-order from a plugin sitting on disk — each
  delta self-labeled by the plugin it came from, so a patch rebuild reads the change instead of re-deriving
  it from two full reads and hand subtraction.
- **`housecarl_cross_plugin_query` gains aggregation.** `defined_in=` narrows a `plugins=` scope from every
  record a plugin *touches* (definitions plus overrides) to only the ones it *defines*; a list-valued
  `references=` runs N reverse-lookups in one scan (each hit labeled with which target it matched);
  `group_by=winner|type|defined_in` returns a count table over **all** matches instead of a capped list; and
  `winner_fields=` reads each match's field values from the true load-order winner — with a loud note when a
  `plugins=` scope is otherwise showing scoped-not-winner values, closing a subtle "these numbers don't
  match what I see in game" trap.
- **`resolve_names=` and `format="json"` across the read surfaces.** `resolve_names=true` annotates every
  FormLink in a read with its EditorID and name inline (display-only — the underlying wire token is
  untouched); `format="json"` returns the same outcomes as a machine-readable document with the accounting
  (truncation, no-value leaves) carried in-band, so a fan-out consumer parses the result instead of scraping
  the text.
- **Batch writes — `composes=` and `CopyFrom`.** A write op can now carry `composes=`: a list of
  build-from-parts elements applied in one operation (`Add` appends each, `ReplaceAll` replaces the whole
  modeled list — and `ReplaceAll composes=[]` clears it). And a new **`CopyFrom`** verb transplants a
  field's value from another plugin's version of the record — active or off-order, any field the reflection
  layer models — the reflection-generic generalization of copying an appearance or a stat block across
  plugins.

**New skill (→ 13)**

- **`bulk-record-jobs` — plan "many records → one structured deliverable" jobs.** Catalogues, link and
  recipe graphs, conflict surveys, patch rebuilds, and any fan-out that extracts structured data: this skill
  routes them onto the bulk primitives above (scoped queries, `group_by`, `resolve`, `diff_record`, batch
  writes) instead of per-record loops, carries the game-generic Creation-Kit conventions those jobs need
  (craft vs temper, what a workbench keyword means structurally), and pins one canonical deliverable schema
  so a fleet of subagents stops inventing eight different output shapes. Game-generic only — a specific mod's
  own conventions stay in that mod's skill.

**Finishing an unenabled plugin, and fixes**

- **A pre-enable finishing lane.** `housecarl_check_errors` and `housecarl_compact_plugin` now accept a
  plugin that isn't enabled yet, and `housecarl_read_plugin_file` locates a mod folder that isn't in your
  load order (a freshly-authored houseCARL patch, found by filename) — so you can sweep, compact, or read a
  just-authored plugin before enabling and sorting it in MO2.
- **SkyPatcher interpretation reads more INIs honestly.** A `skin=<donor NPC>` directive is now classified
  rather than throwing, and a bracketed `[Label]` line is treated as the inert grouping label it is, not a
  malformed patch.
- **New-patch naming is collision-safe and un-doubled.** The default patch stem is now `Patch` — dropping
  the doubled `houseCARL - houseCARL_Patch` — and it is checked against the active load order so a fresh
  patch can't collide with an existing plugin's name.
- **A container-read hint now names a knob that actually exists** (it had pointed at a parameter the tool
  doesn't take).

## 1.7.1 — 2026-07-13

A maintenance release: sharper, louder tool feedback and a write-lane fix. No new tools (still 37) or
skills (still 12).

**Query & read surface**

- **A `where=` filter that finds nothing now tells you *why*.** When a field-value predicate read no value
  on every scanned record, the note used to guess "likely a mistyped path" for *every* cause — so a perfectly
  valid field that simply happens to be unset everywhere read as "this field is unreadable." It now classifies
  the actual cause — a wrong/mistyped field, a container/list path, a read fault, or a valid-but-unset field —
  and names the matching next move (for example, that a dialogue topic's player-facing text lives on the DIAL
  `Name`, not the INFO `Prompt`).
- **Unknown tool parameters are now rejected instead of ignored.** A misspelled or unsupported parameter name
  fails loud, rather than being silently dropped and looking like it had no effect.
- **Clearer container/list rendering and biped-slot decode in reads**, and the `depth=` hint now appears only
  on the tools that actually support it.

**Write lane**

- **`housecarl_set_field` `SetAtIndex` composes modeled list elements correctly** — setting an element of a
  modeled list (rather than a plain scalar) no longer mis-applies.

## 1.7.0 — 2026-07-11

houseCARL learns to **see through more of the runtime layer than the record alone**: merge plugins together,
read and write the data baked inside a mesh (`.nif`), and read the entire SkyPatcher layer end to end — what
it does, where it conflicts, and what a record truly looks like after it replays. **Six new tools (→ 37)**;
the skill set is unchanged at 12. Plus a dialogue CK-parity push and a batch of write-lane fixes.

**Six new tools (→ 37)**

- **`housecarl_merge_plugins` — merge several plugins into one new plugin.** A RECORDS-level merge with a
  winner-first graft walk: it renumbers FormIDs **only on collision**, drops masters the merged set no longer
  needs, and swaps the donor mods out at the **MO2 layer** (their folders stay on disk, just disabled) — your
  originals are never rewritten. References it can't fold are reported, never silently dropped.
- **`housecarl_copy_npc_appearance` — copy an NPC's appearance into a standalone.** The composed payoff of the
  standalone-NPC-copy chain: lift a donor NPC's whole appearance — head parts, tints, and the FaceGen mesh and
  textures — into a fresh record that carries **no dependency on the donor's plugin**, auto-widening the file
  lane to the donor's defining plugin. The build behind a portable follower or a face moved between mods, in
  one call instead of a dozen papercut edits.
- **`housecarl_nif_inspect` — read the data values inside a Skyrim mesh (`.nif`).** Open the winning copy of a
  mesh and read what's baked inside it: shape names, the embedded skin / FaceTint texture paths, shader flags,
  alpha, and partitions. houseCARL's first look *inside* a NIF, and the diagnostic half of the dark-face bug —
  is the face mesh pointing at the wrong texture, or is a shape misnamed?
- **`housecarl_nif_set` — write a whitelisted value back into a mesh (`.nif`).** The write companion to
  `nif_inspect`: rewrite a wrong embedded texture path or rename a shape, gated to a whitelist of safe fields
  and verified two ways — an offset-immune block-content diff **plus** a semantic read-back — so a mesh is
  never quietly corrupted. The repair half of the dark-face fix, without leaving houseCARL for NifSkope.
- **`housecarl_skypatcher_layer` — inventory the entire SkyPatcher layer at once.** Every SkyPatcher INI across
  your load order resolved into one picture: apply-order union, VFS shadows, filename gates, and INI-vs-INI
  conflicts — plus the full **ITM triple** (intra-file dead writes, cross-INI duplicates, and true no-op writes
  that change nothing). Report-only: it tells you what the layer does, it never touches it.
- **`housecarl_skypatcher_read` — a record's true state after SkyPatcher.** Replays the whole SkyPatcher layer
  over a single record, in order, and reports what it actually looks like at runtime — the complete filter
  surface, stateful op-by-op, with tiered honesty on the operations it can't fully model. A runtime INI edit
  made as visible as a plugin override.

**Dialogue & authoring (CK parity)**

- **Authored dialogue now matches the Creation Kit down to the byte on quest aliases.** Beyond the
  INFO / DLVW / DLBR / QUST / DIAL fields 1.6.0 closed, a newly-authored quest alias now gets the flags (FNAM)
  and voice types (VTCK) the CK fills in — so a hand-built quest's aliases don't read as subtly wrong.
- **`housecarl_validate_dialogue` closes the matching residual.** It validates the DLVW / DLBR inputs and the
  quest ANAM / FNAM the CK-parity pass fills, and flags a live INFO that's missing its prompt / response text
  (CNAM / ENAM).
- **The SkyPatcher authoring reference is extended to the full Wave 0–2 grammar** and the 27-record-type
  operation→field map that underpins the two new SkyPatcher tools.

**Fixes**

- **Edit tools resolve the extended patch.** An `@editorid` self-reference, and an edit whose `into=` targets a
  patch you haven't enabled yet, now resolve correctly against the patch being extended.
- **In-place and forward-record flows hardened** against a batch of edge-case defects surfaced in live testing.

## 1.6.0 — 2026-07-06

houseCARL learns to **see the parts of your workspace it was blind to**: read a plugin that isn't in your
active load order (even one inside a disabled mod), inventory the SKSE-plugin (DLL) layer, and catch Papyrus
script properties a plugin declares but never fills. **Three new tools (→ 31) and one new skill (→ 12)** —
plus a substantial dialogue- and record-authoring push, and a batch of silent-wrong and fail-loud fixes.

**Three new tools (→ 31) — new visibility layers**

- **`housecarl_read_plugin_file` — read any plugin file's own records, even one that isn't active.** houseCARL
  builds its world from your active MO2 profile, so a plugin you've unchecked — or one sitting in a *disabled*
  mod folder — used to be invisible. This read-only tool opens a named plugin file directly (active or not, by
  filename or absolute path) and returns **that file's own version** of a record, enumerates the records it
  defines (optionally filtered by type or EditorID), or summarizes it by record type. Every result is loudly
  stamped **OUT-OF-LOAD-ORDER**, so a raw-file read is never mistaken for load-order truth; it has no
  winner/conflict semantics by construction, and it resolves FormLinks against the file's declared masters
  wherever they sit on disk — telling you if one is missing or inactive rather than guessing. This is the
  enabler for inspecting a donor mod *before* you enable it, with no MO2 enable/disable dance to read one file.
- **`housecarl_skse_inventory` — see the SKSE-plugin (DLL) layer.** A full-depth inventory of
  `Data\SKSE\Plugins`: every `.dll` and every config file (grouped by its derived subfolder — SkyPatcher,
  DynamicStringDistributor, OStim, … — never a hardcoded list), each resolved to its winning MO2 provider with
  the **full winner→loser conflict chain** (loose/BSA tagged), and each winning DLL's version metadata decoded
  **statically, without loading it** — name / author / version, Address-Library vs version-locked, target
  runtimes. The record layer has always been houseCARL's home; this is the first look at the binary layer beside
  it, and it's honest about its ceiling: it reads a DLL's declared metadata, never its behavior (a legacy DLL
  whose version is only set at runtime says exactly that; an unreadable PE is flagged, never guessed).
- **`housecarl_validate_scripts` — catch script properties left silently unbound.** A Papyrus script attached to
  a record (VMAD) can declare a property in its compiled `.pex` that the record never actually fills — a silent
  `None` at runtime that throws no error and just makes the script quietly misbehave. This read-only sweep
  compares each attached script's compiled property list against what the record binds and reports the gaps,
  correctly leaving **alias-bound** properties (filled by the quest at runtime, not on the record) alone so they
  aren't false-flagged.

**One new skill (→ 12)**

- **`skse-plugin-authoring` — author an SKSE plugin in C++ against CommonLibSSE-NG.** houseCARL's first skill
  that leaves the data layer for the code layer: it walks the full lifecycle of building an SKSE DLL — project
  scaffolding, the plugin entry points and messaging interface, Papyrus-native functions and hooks, and the
  CommonLibSSE-NG idioms — so Claude can help write a plugin, not just read the records around it. Pairs
  naturally with the new `skse_inventory` tool (see the DLL layer; author into it).

**Dialogue & record authoring**

- **Fill a whole modeled-struct field in one op (`compose-Set`).** `set_field` / `bulk_apply` can now set an
  entire sub-struct in a single operation instead of one leaf field at a time — the authoring ergonomics
  prerequisite behind composed multi-record flows (e.g. rebuilding an NPC's appearance subtree).
- **Clear a nullable field via `Remove`.** A nullable polymorphic field or a nullable sub-struct can now be
  cleared back to unset with `Remove` — for example, un-fragmenting an INFO whose script fragment you want gone,
  cleanly rather than by writing an empty stand-in.
- **`@editorid` same-call sibling references now work inside list fields.** An `Add` / `ReplaceAll` onto a
  FormLink **list** can reference a record created earlier in the same call by its EditorID, so a batch that
  creates records and wires them together no longer needs a second pass for the list-typed links.
- **Single-gender records just author cleanly.** Creating a record with only one half of a gendered FormLink set
  (a single-gender skin/armor) now materializes the un-set half as an empty link instead of crashing, and
  editing an existing single-gender record stays safe.

**Dialogue fixes (CK-parity byte tier + validator)**

- **A newly-authored dialogue record now matches what the Creation Kit writes.** `create_record` / `bulk_create`
  default-populate the byte-level fields the CK fills in on a fresh INFO / DLVW / DLBR / QUST / DIAL that a raw
  insert would leave blank — the class of "byte-valid but plays wrong / won't start" traps that make hand-built
  dialogue silently fail.
- **`housecarl_validate_dialogue` got sharper.** It no longer false-warns on the standard PlayerRef player-state
  gate (see the `check_errors` fix below — same engine-implicit whitelist), flags a `<Global=X>` text tag that
  names a global the owning quest doesn't carry (renders as `[…]` in game), and auto-flags a `.seq` left stale
  by an in-place edit.

**Fixes**

- **`housecarl_check_errors` no longer drowns in false PlayerRef errors.** The integrity sweep was reporting
  every reference to the engine-implicit PlayerRef (`000014`) and Player (`000007`) forms as a dangling
  reference — on a real load order that was hundreds of false positives that overflowed the response. Those
  hardcoded engine forms are now recognized and exempted (a precise two-form whitelist, not the whole reserved
  range, so a genuinely broken low reference still surfaces).
- **`Remove` on a FormLink is now correct in both directions.** Removing a *nullable* scalar FormLink clears it
  to an empty link (instead of throwing); removing a *required* FormLink that can't be legally emptied now fails
  loud with a clear message (instead of silently doing the wrong thing).
- **A failed BSA extraction says why.** When BSArch writes nothing, `housecarl_bsa_extract` now names the actual
  cause instead of reporting an empty success.

## 1.5.0 — 2026-07-02

houseCARL gains **plugin surgery**: ESL-compact a plugin with its FormID-keyed assets (facegen, voice, SEQ)
carried along automatically, and sweep the whole load order for record errors. **Two new tools (→ 28).**
Plus a crash fix for newly-authored dialogue topics, a compact in-place verify read-back, and a batch of
silent-failure and ergonomics fixes.

**Two new tools (→ 28) — plugin surgery arrives**

- **`housecarl_compact_plugin` — ESL-compact a plugin, records AND the files keyed to them.** Renumbers a
  plugin's own records into the ESL FormID window (`0x800`–`0xFFF`), sets the small-master flag, and repoints
  every internal reference — writing a **new** compacted file by default, with the original untouched; editing
  the original in place is opt-in and gated by the same consent handshake as the in-place write lane. What
  sets it apart from a manual compact: **the assets whose filenames encode a FormID move with the records** —
  facegen pairs (facegeom `.nif` + facetint `.dds`) and voice files (`.fuz`/`.lip`) are carried to the new
  FormID paths, and the plugin's `.seq` is regenerated (refresh-only — houseCARL updates a `.seq` that exists
  and warns if one is needed, it never invents one). Renumbering an NPC without renaming its facegen is how a
  compacted mod's faces go dark; the tool closes that whole failure class in one operation. If **other
  plugins** reference the records being renumbered, the tool identifies them by name and fails loud —
  repointing them is a separate opt-in, never a surprise edit.
- **`housecarl_check_errors` — load-order integrity sweep.** The data-layer twin of the Creation Kit's "Check
  For Errors" / xEdit's error check: for every plugin in scope (one, several, or the whole active order) it
  walks every record's FormLinks and reports **dangling references** (a link no active plugin defines),
  **missing masters** (a declared dependency not installed/enabled — the most common load-order break), and
  **parse failures** (records or whole plugins that couldn't be read). Read-only, and explicit about its
  boundary: it covers the reference/master/parse class, not navmesh or terrain spatial integrity.

**Write-lane fixes**

- **In-place verify read-back is now compact by default.** The forced post-write verify on an in-place edit
  used to deep-dump every touched record — on records already carrying big lists it overflowed the response
  budget and could read as "only some of your edits applied" when all of them had. It now renders one
  confirmation line per record (what landed, re-read clean), covering **all** touched records; the full
  field-by-field dump stays behind `full_readback=true`, now bounded so its truncation notice actually reaches
  you. Corruption detection is unchanged — every record is still deep re-read, only the output slimmed.
- **Silent write failures made loud.** A collection verb against an array-backed field now refuses with a
  clear message instead of crashing mid-write, and list elements typed as `IAssetLink` interface forms now
  coerce correctly on write.

**Ergonomics**

- **`housecarl_compile_script` names the real cause of a missing-import failure.** When a compile fails with
  errors dominated by unresolved symbols/types — the signature of an incomplete `import_dirs`, which can
  produce hundreds of errors that look like code bugs — the result now leads with a prominent "incomplete
  import_dirs, not a bug in the script" banner. The classifier is keyed on the compiler's actual error wording
  and gated on a supermajority, so a genuine typo is never mislabeled.
- **A near-miss plugin name now gets a "did you mean."** A `lookup=`/`plugins=`/FormID plugin name that isn't
  in the load order — an apostrophe slip, a typo, or the mod *folder* name passed for the plugin *filename* —
  now suggests the nearest real plugin(s) instead of a flat "not in the load order," across
  `housecarl_load_order_status`, `housecarl_cross_plugin_query`, and `housecarl_read_record`. No suggestion is
  offered unless a candidate genuinely clears the bar — a wrong "did you mean" is worse than none.
- **MO2 2.5.x instances are recognized.** `ModOrganizer.ini` files written in the spaced `key = value` form
  (MO2 2.5.x) now parse correctly.

**Dialogue fixes.** A dialogue topic (DIAL) carries its subtype in two places that must agree — the numeric
`Subtype` and a 4-character `SubtypeName` (SNAM) marker the game actually buckets topics by. houseCARL wrote
the number but left the marker blank, so a newly-authored topic crashed on load (community report #131, by
matashina).

- `housecarl_create_record` / `housecarl_bulk_create` — a new DIAL now gets its **SNAM marker auto-filled**
  from its `Subtype` (`Hello`→`HELO`, `Goodbye`→`GBYE`, a bare/`Custom` topic → `CUST`, …) and reported, so
  it's never silent; an explicit `SubtypeName` you set is never overridden. The subtype→marker table is
  sourced **by construction** from xEdit's DIAL definition (all ~100 subtypes) and CI-guarded against drift.
  A subtype with no modeled marker (an out-of-range value) fails loud instead of writing a blank marker.
- `housecarl_set_field` / `housecarl_bulk_apply` — changing an existing topic's `Subtype` without also setting
  `SubtypeName` now **syncs the marker** to match (both the new-patch and in-place lanes), so a subtype change
  isn't a silent in-game no-op.
- `housecarl_validate_dialogue` — a blank SNAM marker is now a reported issue that names the expected marker:
  an **error** on a newly-authored topic (the #131 crash), a **warning** on an override (where the base
  record's marker can still apply).

## 1.4.0 — 2026-06-24

houseCARL can now **edit an existing plugin in place** — including a mod it didn't author — instead of
only ever writing a separate patch, rounding out the write surface with the same fail-loud,
verify-what-you-touched discipline as the patch lane. Alongside it: three new tools (forward a named
plugin's record as an override, resolve a magic effect's carriers, author an empty trigger plugin), three
new bundled skills (→ **11**), a wider and sharper dialogue validator, a bitwise query predicate for
equip-slot and flag fields, and several silent-wrong-answer fixes. **Three new tools (→ 26), three new
skills (→ 11).** Carries further community contributions from **DrHeisen**.

**In-place write lane — edit, create, and remove records directly in an existing plugin**

- **houseCARL can now write straight into a plugin you point it at — including one it didn't author —
  instead of always emitting a separate patch.** The five write tools (`housecarl_set_field`,
  `housecarl_bulk_apply`, `housecarl_create_record`, `housecarl_bulk_create`, `housecarl_remove_record`)
  gain `target=`, `in_place=true`, and `acknowledge=`. With them houseCARL edits existing records, creates
  brand-new ones (flat, nested children like a dialogue line or a placed reference, or a whole cell), and
  removes records the file carries — rewriting the original plugin the way xEdit or the Creation Kit do on
  save (the author's master list and FormID counter preserved, every record it touched verified on
  read-back). The default new-patch lane is unchanged and stays the default.
- **Behavior change worth knowing:** the in-place lane edits your original file and keeps **no backup** — a
  deliberate departure from houseCARL's default "originals are never touched." It is strictly opt-in
  (`in_place=true`) and gated by a one-time consent handshake per plugin: the first in-place touch of a
  given file names the exact path and the no-undo trade-off and writes nothing until you re-call with
  `acknowledge=true`, then never asks again for that plugin (the consent is remembered across sessions and
  shared across edit / create / remove). Keep your own backup of anything you edit in place. Files edited
  this way are marked `editedInPlace` (never houseCARL-owned), so a later `into=` extend can't
  blind-overwrite your mod. A plugin whose own records use reserved sub-`0x800` FormIDs (vanilla / Creation
  Club) is refused in place — you override those, you don't edit them.

**New tools**

- **`housecarl_forward_record` — copy a named plugin's version of a record as an override.** The inverse of
  `set_field` / `bulk_apply`, and the data-layer equivalent of xEdit's "copy as override into": it copies a
  *named* earlier plugin's whole record verbatim into a patch so it wins again — re-assert one mod's version
  of a record over a later override, or name a master to revert a record to vanilla. Works for every record
  type, nested Cell / Placed / INFO families included. It refuses loudly (writing no file) on a bad source —
  one not in the load order, the output patch itself, a source that doesn't define the record, the same
  target named twice — and flags a forward whose version already wins as redundant.
- **`housecarl_effect_chain` — a magic effect's carriers and magnitudes in one call.** Point it at a
  MagicEffect (MGEF) and it resolves every spell, enchantment, potion, scroll, and ingredient across the
  load order that applies it, each with the magnitude / area / duration from the matching effect entry (as
  authored — conditions are not evaluated). It collapses the old "query references, then read each hit" loop
  across five record types into one read, and fails loud rather than returning a silent zero: a
  non-MagicEffect FormID errors naming the real type, an absent FormID errors, and a genuinely unused effect
  returns a clean, distinguishable zero.
- **`housecarl_create_plugin` — author an empty header-only "trigger" plugin.** Emits a valid plugin with a
  TES4 header and zero records — the clean primitive for "I just need `Foo.esp` to exist": a basename-bound
  SKSE config trigger (the CraftingCategories-style pattern where a config loads because `Foo.esp` is
  present), a placeholder ESL for FormID reservation, or a dummy master. Before, a trigger plugin had to
  carry a junk filler record that polluted the conflict tree. The name is used verbatim (the basename is
  load-bearing, so no auto-suffix) and a collision refuses loudly rather than renaming or overwriting;
  `esl=true` flags it a light master.

**Dialogue validation & authoring**

- **`housecarl_validate_dialogue` gained five new lint families** (all advisory — it warns, never blocks,
  never auto-fixes): text-encoding (a player-facing string carrying a non-ASCII character that would render
  as in-game mojibake, with the offending character and an ASCII substitute named); result-script fragment
  presence (how many of a topic's lines actually carry a script fragment, so you know whether to expect
  runtime behavior); SEQ staleness / coverage (a Start-Game-Enabled quest whose plugin has no `.seq`, a
  `.seq` that doesn't list it, or one older than the plugin — meaning the quest and all its dialogue
  silently never start on a fresh save — and it also tells you when a regen is *not* needed); and static
  condition (CTDA) well-formedness (dead run-on references, dead alias indices, dangling form / global
  parameters, GetIsID pointed at a placed reference instead of a base object).
- **Deep reads now show VMAD script-property values.** A `depth>=2` read of a script's Properties prints
  each property's value — the Object FormLink, the Data scalar, the alias — instead of stopping at the
  identity line, matching xEdit; a declared-but-unset Object shows a named `(null link)` rather than
  vanishing.
- **Condition form targets accept the flat `fields:` shorthand.** Composing a condition's data arm and
  setting its form-link-or-index target through the flat `fields:` map (e.g.
  `GetEquipped {ItemOrList: "0001F4:Skyrim.esm"}`) was wrongly refused at pre-flight; it now lands a target
  in both form and alias-index mode, byte-identical to the verbose path, across the whole FLOI
  condition-parameter class.
- **The `dialogue-authoring` skill gained substantial reference depth** — CK pages for decoding a CTDA
  condition (a ~40-function dialogue table), the DLBR branch entry point and its Exclusive-branch deadlock,
  and the quest stage / objective model; a set of authoring traps the flow model implies but the validator
  can't catch (Stop() resets a quest's stage, a monologue is several Responses in one line, CK conditions
  can't express (A AND B) OR (C AND D), GetStageDone vs GetStage); and write-side recipes for cloning a
  verified condition gate across many lines and writing a CK-refused INFO subtype.

**Querying & equip slots**

- **`housecarl_cross_plugin_query` gained a `has` bitwise predicate** for bitmask / flag fields:
  `where ... has Body` (or a bit value, decimal or `0x` hex) matches if that bit is set regardless of the
  others — so a multi-slot armor whose `BodyTemplate.FirstPersonFlags` carries body *plus* a modder slot is
  now findable, where exact `=` only matched a single-slot piece. For `[Flags]` enum fields, range operators
  now compare the numeric value (`>= 65536` no longer errors) and `=` / `!=` equate by resolved bits (so
  `= 16` matches a field that renders as the flag name). **Behavior change:** a query that relied on the old
  exact-string-or-error behavior for a `[Flags]` field may now return different results; non-flags enums are
  unchanged.
- **New `biped-slot-reference` skill** — the ergonomic layer over `has`: it turns a biped slot (a number
  like 52, a vanilla name like Body, or a community label like SOS / pelvis) into the `FirstPersonFlags` bit
  to query on, so finding every armor on a slot is a lookup instead of power-of-two mental math. Ships a
  verified slot 30–61 table (the named bits are non-contiguous — the trap a from-memory table gets wrong)
  and the multi-slot query pattern.

**Correctness fixes**

- **Localized fields on cleaned base-game masters read correctly again.** A localized master sitting in a
  folder with no strings of its own — the near-universal "Cleaned Base Game Masters" setup, where a cleaned
  DLC / Update `.esm` lives in a bare folder while its `.STRINGS` stay in the game-Data BSAs — was reading
  every localized field (Name, DESC, …) as **empty**, so `where Name contains …` silently zero-matched the
  DLC masters and a read showed a blank Name. houseCARL now points the strings lookup at the real game-Data
  folder when (and only when) the plugin's own folder carries no strings source. **Behavior change:**
  queries and reads against those masters can now return matches and content where they used to find
  nothing. As defense-in-depth, a genuinely unresolved localized string now renders the loud
  `(unresolved localized string)` note instead of a blank that looked like a real value.
- **`into=` resolves a renamed patch folder.** Extending your own houseCARL patch after you renamed its MO2
  mod folder for organization used to fail — `into=` demanded folder name, suffix, and `.esp` basename all
  match. It now resolves by plugin name (the folder holding `<stem>.esp`, whatever it's now called) then
  folder name, refusing loud only if two owned folders are genuinely ambiguous. The same fix was extended to
  the rider / asset write path behind `compile_script`, `decompile_script`, `bsa_repack`, `place_asset`, and
  `bulk_place_asset`, which had still carried the old three-way match. A foreign, un-owned plugin stays
  refused.

**New skills & reference depth**

- **New `oar-authoring` skill** *(DrHeisen)* — author or interpret Open Animation Replacer (OAR) configs:
  the runtime, condition-driven animation system (`config.json` / `user.json`) that supersedes DAR and still
  reads its legacy `_conditions.txt` folders. Ships a source-verified reference (the full schema, the
  ~120-condition roster, the authoritative `IsEquippedType` enum — which OAR deliberately diverges from the
  vanilla `GetEquippedItemType` enum — the DAR grammar, and the global INI) plus a playbook for the
  counter-intuitive parts: OAR ignores plugin load order and picks winners purely by `priority`; the
  top-level array is lowercase `conditions` while a nested `AND`/`OR` child array is capital-C `Conditions`;
  `user.json` is a full-document shadow of `config.json`; and an addon condition (Math / RaySense / IED /
  Detection / Dialogue) silently no-ops when its DLL is absent. It complements the distributor skills — it
  authors animation CONFIGS, while forms-to-NPCs is SPID, keywords-to-items is KID, and record fields is
  SkyPatcher.
- **New `tool-output-awareness` skill** *(DrHeisen)* — recognize the plugins and assets that generated tools
  produce (Reqtificator, ParallaxGen, DynDOLOD, Synthesis, TexGen, xLODGen, NPC Plugin Chooser 2) and keep
  their re-derived records and asset paths out of an authored patch, so you never bake a regenerable
  artifact into a hand patch that goes stale — or silently breaks — the next time the tool runs.
- **`papyrus-reference` now loads before any `.psc` read *or* edit** — including an edit that only reuses a
  call already in the file (a copied call is not a verified call; "the compiler will catch it" covers
  signatures, not semantics) — and bundles a new "silent-biters" reference of Papyrus traps that compile
  clean but misbehave at runtime (GetFormEx vs GetForm for the ESL range, SendModEvent handler arity,
  FormList.HasForm missing base NPCs, Utility.Wait in a paused-menu handler, and more).

## 1.3.0 — 2026-06-21

The biggest release since 1.0: a VFS-aware **asset layer** (read which copy of any file wins; place a file
as a winning override), end-to-end **dialogue authoring** (compose a whole conversation in one call, audit a
dialogue graph, write start-game-enabled `.seq` files), a Mutagen-native **script decompiler**, a much wider
and more honest **write pre-flight**, and a broad sweep of **crash-atomic / MO2-disk correctness**
hardening. Seven new tools, two new skills. Carries an outside code contribution from **AlmightyChan** (the
`create_record into=` upsert, #44/#45).

**VFS asset layer & FaceGen**

- **houseCARL now answers "which copy of a file actually wins?" the same way it answers it for records.** A new VFS-aware asset layer resolves any Data-relative path — mesh, texture, script, sound, interface file — against the active load order and reports the winning copy (the overwrite folder, a specific mod, Data, or inside a BSA), loose-vs-BSA aware. This is the file-layer counterpart to a record's load-order winner: before, houseCARL could tell you which plugin wins a record but had no way to tell you which mod or archive wins a given file path. Exposed through the new `housecarl_asset_status`, running against the real, live load order with zero file/archive handles held at rest — the same contract as the record resolver, so MO2/xEdit can move files freely.
- **You can now place a file as a winning override into a fresh houseCARL mod.** Two new tools write the asset side: `housecarl_place_asset` puts one file in place, and `housecarl_bulk_place_asset` puts many into a single mod folder in one call. The source can be a loose file, one entry pulled out of a BSA, or a whole BSA; the destination can be a raw asset path or — for an NPC's FaceGen — a FormID plus kind (mesh/tint), with the path computed from the FormKey. Before, houseCARL could read which copy of a file wins but could only tell you what to do by hand to make a different copy win. Writes are crash-atomic and non-destructive: originals are untouched, a fully-failed batch leaves no orphan folder, and a reused destination folder is never deleted. The tools are honest that "wrote it" is not "it wins" — every response reports the current winner and the MO2 enable-plus-sort step still required.
- **New `facegen-diagnostics` skill.** houseCARL's 7th shipped skill walks the dark / grey / black-face NPC bug end to end — it resolves the NPC to a FormKey and compares two independent precedence systems (which plugin wins the NPC record vs which mod or BSA wins the facegen `.nif`/`.dds` file), then either places the correct facegen as a winning override or forwards the matching appearance into a new plugin. Where the fix needs the Creation Kit, NifSkope, or RaceMenu it instructs the steps rather than faking them, and it gates every "done" behind an in-game verification handoff. It drives the new asset tools and ships with a 24-cause taxonomy and symptom table. (The asset tools themselves are framed as a general VFS capability — "which copy of any file wins" — with FaceGen as the headline use case rather than the framing.)

**Dialogue authoring & validation**

- **Author a whole dialogue conversation in one command.** `housecarl_create_record` gained optional parent/collection arguments, and a new `housecarl_bulk_create` allocates a parent and its children in a single all-or-nothing call — a DialogTopic with its INFO response lines nested under it, each with a fresh local `0x800+` FormKey. The add-target is found by construction over the parent's modeled child-collections (never per-record-type hand-wiring), and the unique / named / missing / ambiguous outcomes all fail loud. Before, the data layer could create flat records but had no way to allocate a brand-new child into a parent's collection, so a dialogue line under a topic was out of reach.
- **Same-call sibling references wire the conversation together.** Inside a `housecarl_bulk_create` call, a FormLink value of the form `@editorid` forward-references a record created earlier in the same call, resolved to that sibling's auto-allocated FormKey after allocation — so an INFO's Topic back-link and its PreviousDialog can point at sibling records that don't exist until the call runs. The mechanism is generic across any FormLink on any created record, and the sibling token is accepted only as a singular Set on a FormLink leaf, in create context, for an editorid declared earlier; everywhere else (a later/self reference, a non-FormLink field, a value inside a list or dict, the edit-existing path) it rejects loud rather than silently substituting nothing.
- **New dialogue lines are checked for the audio and scripts they need to actually work.** A byte-valid INFO can still do nothing in game — no `.fuz` on disk plays silent, and a half-built or uncompiled result-script binding fires nothing. On a successful create, the response now folds in two on-disk checks. Voice coverage flags each created voiced response that has no audio, printing the exact `Sound\Voice` `.fuz`/`.lip` path to place it at (and naming the winning provider when audio is already present); when the path can't be computed (no Speaker, or an unresolvable voice type) it says so with a named reason instead of a false "fine". Result-script binding flags an INFO whose VirtualMachineAdapter is hollow or whose bound script class has no compiled `Scripts\<class>.pex` on disk, naming the missing path. Script-free lines are never nagged.
- **New tool `housecarl_validate_dialogue` audits an existing dialogue graph on demand.** Point it at a DialogTopic (DIAL) or Quest (QUST) FormID and it resolves the load-order winners and reports the wiring: whether the quest is set and resolves (unowned is a warning), whether a set branch resolves to a real DLBR (unset is normal), the INFO.LinkTo topic-to-topic chain with broken links flagged, and a dangling PNAM **only** when it is set-but-unresolvable — empty PNAM is never flagged, since vanilla topics legitimately leave it empty and select within a topic by Conditions. It reuses the voice and result-script checks over every live INFO (closing the edit-path audit gap the create-time checks left open) and always declares the parts it cannot check (CTDA/lip-sync, the dropped-INFO conflict boundary). Read-only.
- **New tool `housecarl_write_seq` makes start-game-enabled quests actually start.** Without a `Data\SEQ\<plugin>.seq` file, a plugin's Start-Game-Enabled quests — and any dialogue gated on them — silently never start. `housecarl_write_seq` is the data-layer equivalent of the CK's on-save SEQ generation or xEdit's "Create SEQ file": point it at a plugin and it writes the `.seq` its SGE quests need. The encoding (a flat array of little-endian master-index FormIDs, never the runtime `0xFE` form) was pinned empirically against all 145 real `.seq` files in a live load order, so the file is computed wholly at author time with no runtime bridge. It writes crash-atomically and non-destructively, defaults the `.seq` into the plugin's own houseCARL folder so there's one mod to enable, and a plugin with zero SGE quests writes nothing rather than an empty file.
- **New `dialogue-authoring` skill** ties the dialogue tools into a playbook for the five Creation-Kit bookkeeping jobs a byte-valid insert skips — the silent-failure class houseCARL refuses (a line that passes xEdit but skips them plays nothing in game). It encodes the counter-intuitive dialogue policy (PNAM is ~unused; Conditions, not list order, select the line; the winning topic silently drops any line it doesn't re-list), drives `housecarl_bulk_create` / `housecarl_create_record`, `housecarl_compile_script`, `housecarl_write_seq`, and `housecarl_validate_dialogue` through those jobs, then validates the result — and reads or audits existing dialogue (what a topic does, why a line won't fire, a dropped-line conflict).

**Script toolchain**

- **Decompile any compiled script back to reviewable source.** New tool `housecarl_decompile_script` reconstructs readable `.psc` source from a compiled `.pex` with no external decompiler or compiler involved (Mutagen-native) — measured at 100% structuring (one named irreducible) and 98.80% byte-exact recompile round-trips across all 10,189 provable script pairs in a 3,400-plugin load order. Before, the only way to read what a shipped `.pex` actually does was an outside tool or guesswork. Inherent PEX losses are stated where you see them (parameter defaults are baked at call sites; comments and layout are gone), anything it can't prove fails loudly in the output (raw bytecode in the `.psc`, counted in the result) rather than rendering a silent wrong answer, and it never overwrites an existing file. BSA-packed scripts compose with `housecarl_bsa_extract` first.
- **Compiling against a mod's extended script copy now works.** When you pass `import_dirs` to `housecarl_compile_script`, your folders now outrank the vanilla auto-import (order is own folder, then your `import_dirs`, then vanilla last). Before, a vanilla copy of an extended source (SKSE's `Actor.psc` / `Game.psc` / `Form.psc` especially) shadowed the extended one — the CK compiler takes the first match — so any call to an extended function failed "not a function or does not exist" even when you had explicitly pointed at the right folder. Explicit now beats implicit, matching the game's runtime; calls passing no `import_dirs` behave exactly as before.
- **Reliability hardening across the script and BSA bridge.** The decompiler's optimizer-origin hint now also fires on statement-level `JMPT` (a flow pattern the CK compiler provably never emits), flagging a wider class of Caprica-optimized scripts — while the description keeps the honest floor: detection is pattern-based, two named flow-canonical files still stay silent, and the note's absence does **not** prove CK origin. The BSArch bridge no longer false-succeeds: `housecarl_bsa_extract` now judges success by this-run provenance (a new path, or a changed size/mtime vs a pre-run snapshot) instead of "a folder entry exists afterward" (which the ownership marker alone satisfied, so a failed run looked successful); packing refuses loud on a stale leftover scratch rather than moving it over the target; `housecarl_bsa_list` errors on any parse failure (a declared-vs-listed count mismatch is reported, not papered over); archive paths are fully normalized; and an unknown `format=` token refuses and names the legal set.

**Write pre-flight (records, fields, collections)**

- **More record shapes are composable end-to-end — edits that route through a polymorphic field validate and write where they used to be rejected.** Several common fields are polymorphic (they take one of a set of "arms" depending on what's there). Writes to a standalone polymorphic field (an NPC's Level or Sound, a dialogue script fragment, a Condition's data) used to be rejected by pre-flight because it couldn't see fields that exist only on one arm, or it over-rejected a field present on several write-identical arms as a "conflicting shape". Pre-flight now descends into the arms and admits exactly what the engine can write, and you can select a polymorphic sub-arm inside a nested compose (e.g. giving a Condition its data shape), which previously had no way to be expressed.
- **Bad collection-element edits now fail at the gate with a clear message, not a cryptic crash mid-write.** When you Add / Set / ReplaceAll / Merge / Remove an element of a list or dictionary field (a keyword on an NPC, a LinkTo on a dialogue response, a faction entry, a skill weight), houseCARL now checks the element up front — that a required value or dict key/list index is present, that a malformed FormID or unparseable value is caught, and that a key or index has the right shape. Before, these slipped past pre-flight and threw an unnamed exception deep in apply, which houseCARL surfaced as the alarming "pre-flight accepted it but apply threw — a real inconsistency", pointing you at an internal bug when the real problem was a fixable input. The check is by-construction across every collection field, so the gate rejects exactly what apply would have thrown on.
- **Malformed writes fail by name before touching disk.** Clearing a FormLink with a zero value (`00000000` or `0`) now clears the link instead of throwing "malformed FormKey" at write time (and a real FormID is never mistaken for a clear); a composed record left missing a required arm now fails with a named `NullArmSerializeException` saying what's missing instead of a bare null-reference crash; and bracketing a gendered field at its end now points you at the right `.Male`/`.Female` form rather than suggesting list verbs that don't apply. In every case the staged write is all-or-nothing — your originals and the in-progress output are untouched when a write is refused.
- **Expected, fixable write errors now read as fixable input, not internal inconsistencies.** A class of errors pre-flight legitimately cannot catch — an out-of-range list index, adding a dict key that already exists, removing a value/key that isn't there, navigating into an absent collection — used to be wrapped in the same "real inconsistency" alarm as genuine engine bugs. These now render cleanly with actionable guidance while still refusing the whole call and writing no file; genuine gate/apply drift still gets the loud wrapper, and malformed pre-existing source data is now called out as its own category rather than blamed on your input. **Behavior change worth noting:** Remove of an absent value or key is now a surfaced rejection rather than a silent no-op — a script that relied on "remove X if present" being a safe no-op will now have the whole call refused when X is absent.
- **Gendered fields are now editable through the same `[0]`/`[1]` form the reader shows you.** Fields holding a male/female pair (an armor's WorldModel, for example) display in a read as `[0]` and `[1]`, but feeding that exact form back used to be both unreadable and unwritable — only the longer `.Male`/`.Female` path worked. Now `[0]` (male) and `[1]` (female) are a true read-and-write alias, and a write to a not-yet-present arm is materialized and written through correctly rather than silently dropped.
- **Create GlobalVariable, GameSetting, and AI-package Data inputs — previously un-authorable.** GlobalVariable and GameSetting sit under an abstract group, so `create_record` refused them outright; it now creates the concrete shape you ask for (`GlobalFloat`, `GameSettingFloat`, and the rest), with the arms discovered from Mutagen's own type hierarchy and a bare "Global"/"GameSetting" request failing loud with the real choices. Separately, `Package.Data` — the one struct-valued dictionary Mutagen models, holding an AI package's typed inputs (travel/escort target, sandbox/patrol location, literals, object list, dialogue topic) and the last package piece houseCARL could read but not write — is now composable, with a duplicate-key add refused by name ("use Set to overwrite") rather than a raw library error.
- **Polymorphic base types are no longer offered as a legal arm of themselves.** A concrete base type (an AI-package Data entry, a Condition, a VMAD script property) was incorrectly listed as an arm of itself — and composing `Package.Data` by its own name silently wrote a degenerate empty entry, the worst failure class. The gate now rejects composing a base by its own name and filters it out of the legal-arms list, and the bundled `mutagen-reference` schema no longer self-lists those bases (a display fix, no change to which arms are actually composable).
- **Conflict diffs tell an identical-to-winner override apart from a field the plugin simply doesn't carry.** The winner-relative conflict view used to show only differences, so an override that restates a field identically to the winner (an ITM edit) looked the same as a plugin that doesn't touch that field at all — and a not-carried field rendered as a confusing phantom "(absent)" delta. The diff now reports an agreed-with-winner count so an ITM restate is detectable, and renders a not-carried nullable field as "ABSENT here (winner has X)". Per-field presence is reliable for nullable fields; the tool never claims a presence signal it can't prove.

**Robustness & MO2-disk correctness**

- **Every write is now crash-atomic — a power loss or crash mid-save can never leave a torn plugin.** All final-swap writes (the `.esp` patch, the BSA repack, the config save) now commit through one shared primitive that uses the Win32 atomic content-swap when the target exists and an atomic rename for a fresh file. Before, these used `File.Move(overwrite)`, which is not crash-atomic — it can unlink the destination before the rename commits. After, a crash leaves either the complete old file or the complete new file, never a missing or half-written one, and a cross-volume swap refuses loud rather than silently degrading to a non-atomic copy.
- **Re-running a write replaces the patch's own record in place instead of piling up duplicates** *(AlmightyChan — #44/#45)*. Re-running `create_record into=` an existing patch now replaces the patch's own same-EditorID record fresh at the same FormKey. Before, every re-run appended a duplicate, FormIDs crept upward, and external references went stale. The replace is never silent (flagged as same FormID kept, prior contents discarded), an attempt to clobber a carried override from the original plugin refuses loud and points you at `set_field`/`bulk_apply`, and leftover duplicate copies from the old bug refuse loud naming every copy's FormKey.
- **Concurrent tool calls can no longer collide on the same output plugin or cross-commit each other's bytes.** The whole resolve-stage-commit of a write is now serialized behind a write gate, and output-path allocation runs under the same lock. Before, the MCP SDK dispatches tool calls concurrently with no mutual exclusion, so two writes defaulting to the same plugin name could allocate the same folder and cross-commit (one call's success message shipping the other's bytes), and concurrent `into=` extends could silently lose the first call's edits. An instance switch can no longer tear a write in flight.
- **Plugins in MO2's overwrite folder now resolve, and a copy there correctly wins on top of the load order.** Plugins living in MO2's overwrite folder — where tool outputs land (Synthesis patches, xEdit "new file", Wrye Bash) — are now resolved, beating every mod (MO2's own rule) with enabled mods next and the game Data folder as the lowest fallback. Before, these were unresolvable and the warning misdiagnosed them as a stale-profile problem a re-sort can't fix. The lazy-mtime contract is unchanged: a plugin in overwrite changes the winning path once the profile files change, which MO2 writes on refresh.
- **A refused write no longer leaves behind an empty orphan folder.** When a write is refused at pre-flight ("NO patch written"), houseCARL now removes the empty folder and `meta.ini` it had created instead of accreting `_001`/`_002` folders on every retry. The deletion is content-checked — it only removes a folder holding nothing but our own `meta.ini` and an empty staging dir, never a reused `into=` folder — and the same cleanup covers failed rider tools (`bsa_repack` / `compile_script` / `decompile_script`), keeping (and naming) any folder that holds real output.
- **Your saved MO2 instance and tool paths can no longer be silently wiped, and a corrupt config is recovered loudly.** The user config now writes atomically (temp + rename) and guards the whole read-modify-write under a cross-process mutex, so the CLI plugin and desktop app sharing the file can't clobber each other. Before, a non-atomic write plus a corrupt file silently parsing as blank meant the next update wrote blank-plus-one-field back with `ok=true`, wiping your saved instance and tool paths. Now a corrupt file is backed up to `.corrupt.bak` and reported (a RECOVERED line on `set_mo2_instance`/`set_tool_path`, and at boot). Never silently blank.
- **Reads and writes now answer from a single consistent snapshot, and freshness no longer misses backups or restores.** The write path captures one index view up front and answers every edit's resolve/fetch/excluded-check off it (before, it re-resolved per edit, so a freshness rebuild landing mid-loop could resolve two edits of one call against two different builds — a silently mixed patch). Freshness detection was hardened too: it compares profile/ini mtimes by value rather than wall-clock, so MO2's "Restore Backup" (an older mtime) is no longer invisible; SetInstance stamps its baseline before the read; the status line is snapshotted under one lock; and a concurrent read's refresh defers rather than rebuilds under an in-flight write. The promise that an answer reflects current MO2 state holds without a daemon.

**Ergonomics & setup**

- **Load-order status now names the MO2 instance and reads any profile without switching to it.** The status header shows the resolved instance path, the default view lists the other profiles available, and `profile=<name>` inspects an inactive profile's mods and plugins read-only, leaving the active profile untouched. (Instance-mode only; a `profile=` read refuses loudly in explicit-paths mode, an unknown name lists the real profiles, and never-opened stray profile folders are skipped so they can't render as an all-zero phantom.)
- **The Papyrus compiler and BSA tools auto-detect their game directory and the real Steam install.** houseCARL looks for `PapyrusCompiler.exe` under the load order's game directory, and for the common MO2 "Stock Game" layout — where the load order points at a copy with no Creation Kit — it also locates the real Steam install (App 489830) where the CK and vanilla script sources live, with no new dependencies. A genuinely missing dependency now names exactly where it looked, and tool paths are locked so they survive an instance switch. (`housecarl_set_tool_path` becomes a fallback rather than a requirement.)
- **`housecarl_compile_script` takes an `output_dir=` so the compiled `.pex` lands where you choose.** The folder is treated as user-owned, so residue cleanup never deletes it, and deployability reporting is tight — only `<mods>\<modFolder>\Scripts` or `<data>\Scripts` counts as deployable, so a bare or nested path warns instead of falsely reporting a clean "done".
- **The setup installer pre-flights a locked, running server before it overwrites anything — and names the locked exe.** Re-running `houseCARL-Setup.exe` over a live install used to try to overwrite the running `housecarl-mcp.exe`, throw mid-copy, and leave a half-updated tree behind a generic "setup did not complete". Setup now checks for a locked server exe at every destination it would touch (both the Claude and Codex install locations) before any copy runs and refuses with actionable "fully quit Claude/Codex, then re-run" guidance — a clean first install is never blocked. A sharing-violation that slips past the pre-flight is caught with the same guidance, while an unrelated IOException (disk full, etc.) still fails honestly, and the refusal is worded precisely: "nothing was changed" only for a true pre-flight refusal.

**Display & schema honesty**

- **Display-honesty fixes across record schemas, Nexus text, and patch naming.** A read-only-projection leak was closed in the record-schema corpus: Mutagen concrete-class getters with no mutable twin (e.g. `SkyrimMultiModOverlay`, `MergedCellBlock`) were leaking into the catalog as the sole legal arm of their container and are now filtered to authorable arms only (losing no writable coverage — `CellBlock` even becomes a normally-composable struct — and caught by construction going forward via a new corpus guard). A cosmetic sweep fixed several rendering bugs: a dotted patch name like `My.Cool.Patch` was being clipped at the first dot (corrupting the plugin and MO2 folder name) and now strips only a trailing plugin extension; Nexus description truncation no longer splits an emoji/CJK glyph in half; double-encoded HTML entities decode correctly; and several stale tool descriptions/comments were corrected to match actual behavior.
- **The `mutagen-reference` skill now documents field addressing and per-op support.** It spells out the bracket/dot path grammar for reaching a field, a list element, or a dict entry, and which write verbs (Set / Add / Remove / ReplaceAll / SetAtIndex / Merge) each field shape accepts — so a write is composed from the reference rather than guessed.

## 1.2.3 — 2026-06-11

Opens the script-property write surface, adds a write-and-verify loop, and hardens tool-argument handling
and setup — carrying houseCARL's first outside code contributions (thanks, **WraithFallen**). No change to
the tool set.

- **Script-property (VMAD) writes work** *(WraithFallen — #35/#38)*: paths and composes that go through a
  polymorphic field's arms — setting a script property's target object, editing a quest alias's script
  fields, adding a `ScriptObjectProperty` to a script's property list — now validate against the arm's own
  schema and write end-to-end. Before, the write pre-flight couldn't see fields that exist only on one arm
  of a polymorphic type, so those edits were rejected; reads already worked. The surface is generic over
  every polymorphic family — no per-type wiring — and the cases an arm can't support still fail with a
  named reason.
- **Malformed tool arguments coerce or fail by name** *(#36, string-encoded-array case by WraithFallen)*:
  Claude Code's client sometimes sends an array argument as a plain string or as a JSON-array-in-a-string
  (`"[\"A.esp\"]"`); both shapes now bind as the array they spell. A missing required argument refuses by
  name, an uncoercible shape fails with a named reason, and an unexpected error inside any tool now returns
  a named error — never the SDK's generic text.
- **Write-and-verify in one step:** the write tools gain an opt-in `full_readback=` that returns every
  record the write touched or created — in full, read back off the *written file* — so a patch can be
  verified before it's ever enabled in MO2.
- **Honest answer for a plugin that isn't in the load order:** a `plugin=` read naming a plugin that isn't
  in the current order now gets its own named error saying exactly that, instead of the false "does not
  define this record".
- **Consistent answers while the load order changes:** each logical operation now reads from one captured
  index snapshot, so an MO2 change landing mid-query can no longer tear a result (winner, touching list,
  and counters always come from the same view).
- **Setup is self-contained and pre-flights the runtimes:** `houseCARL-Setup.exe` no longer needs .NET
  installed to run, and it checks for *both* required .NET runtimes up front with a specific fix message.
  The install docs are corrected accordingly — installing the ASP.NET Core Runtime does **not** include the
  base .NET runtime.
- **Authoring skills load for reading, not just writing:** the SkyPatcher / SPID / KID skills now also fire
  when *interpreting or auditing* an existing INI — "what does this `_DISTR.ini` do", "is this NPC
  affected", "why isn't this line applying" — so those answers come from the bundled grammar references
  instead of memory.

## 1.2.2 — 2026-06-10

Fixes four issues surfaced auditing a Requiem load order — all in reads and writes, no change to the tool
set.

- **New records get valid FormIDs:** creating a record in a patch that was first written by a bulk apply
  could allocate FormIDs starting at `000000` — the null range the game and other tools reject. houseCARL
  now floors every new-record allocation at `0x800` (the user range Bethesda reserves) from every write
  path, and persists a floored high-water mark into the patch so later edits and removals never regress it.
  Patches that already carry a `000000` record stay readable and editable — nothing is auto-renumbered,
  which would break references.
- **Conflict diffs compare real content:** the conflict tree's "what differs between these overrides"
  comparison looked only at top-level field counts, so two overrides that changed the *contents* of a list
  or struct without changing its length could be reported as identical. The diff now walks the record's
  full depth — list elements compared order-insensitively, sub-structs and nested values compared by value
  — so a genuine deep difference is no longer missed, and the output stays honest when a record is too
  large to fully expand.
- **One unreadable record no longer breaks a whole query:** a single record Mutagen can't parse — for
  example a malformed perk an upstream ESP ships — used to abort an *entire* `housecarl_cross_plugin_query`
  that scans references, returning nothing. houseCARL now isolates the offending record, scans past it, and
  reports how many records were skipped and why, so the rest of the results come through.
- **Form-targeted conditions read correctly:** a condition that points at a form — `HasPerk`,
  `HasMagicEffect`, `GetInFaction`, and the like — used to render a placeholder instead of the form's
  FormID when read. houseCARL now resolves the target through its link, so those condition payloads show
  their real FormID.

## 1.2.1 — 2026-06-08

Adds value-based record querying and a fuller Nexus lookup, and fixes several read and write rough edges.

- **Query by field value:** `housecarl_cross_plugin_query` gains a `where=` filter that matches records
  by a field's *value*, not just by record type or plugin — e.g. `where="MagicSkill = Destruction"` or
  `where="BasicStats.Damage >= 50"`. Operators are `=`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, and `contains`, and
  multiple `where=` conditions are ANDed. It works on any field you can read (by construction — the
  filterable set is the readable set); a path that can't resolve fails loud rather than silently matching
  nothing.
- **Full Nexus descriptions:** `housecarl_nexus_mod` takes an opt-in `description=true` that returns a
  mod's full Nexus page write-up — cleaned from the page markup to plain text — instead of only the short
  catalogue summary.
- **Write into an active patch:** writing into a patch that is itself active in the load order no longer
  fails with a file-lock error — houseCARL releases every mapped handle on the target before it saves.
- **Deep reads of condition-bearing records:** a deep read (`depth` 5+) of a record that carries
  conditions — a perk, spell, or magic effect — no longer floods the output with .NET reflection
  internals; the descent now stops at the modeled record content, so the real values stay visible.
- **Scoped queries show the scoped record:** under a `plugins=` scope, `housecarl_cross_plugin_query`
  now renders each match from that plugin's own record body rather than the global load-order winner.

## 1.2.0 — 2026-06-07

houseCARL reads Nexus Mods directly, and gains a community-contributed Papyrus performance reviewer.

- **Nexus Mods lookups:** two keyless, read-only tools — `housecarl_nexus_search` (search the Skyrim SE
  catalogue) and `housecarl_nexus_mod` (one mod's version, requirements, and *true* latest release — its
  newest MAIN file, since a mod's own version header can lag) — answer Nexus questions directly through
  the public Nexus catalogue API: no browser, no
  account, no API key. Read-only — houseCARL finds and informs; downloading stays your mod manager's
  "Mod Manager Download" handoff. Offline-tolerant: with no connection it says so plainly and every
  local capability keeps working.
- **`papyrus-optimization` skill:** a bundled Papyrus performance reviewer — classify each part of a
  `.psc` as broken / suboptimal / clean, explain what makes it heavy, and give the fix (event-driven,
  caching, states, native offload). houseCARL's first community-contributed skill, by DrHeisen.

## 1.1.3 — 2026-06-07

Hardens houseCARL against a malformed plugin that could otherwise make every command fail.

- **Resilient load-order indexing:** a single record Mutagen can't parse — for example a malformed package
  data-input count that an upstream ESP ships and the game engine ignores — used to make *every* houseCARL
  command fail with a Mutagen error, because the whole-load-order index is built up front and one bad record
  threw the entire build. houseCARL now isolates the offending plugin: it is excluded from the session and
  reported in `housecarl_load_order_status` (with the reason why), while every other plugin stays fully
  readable. Fix or remove the upstream plugin to restore access to it.

## 1.1.2 — 2026-06-06

Fixes a silent lookup failure in the Papyrus reference skill, and ships the corrected third-party credits.

- **Papyrus reference lookup fix:** the `papyrus-reference` skill documented its function-index grep with a
  format that no longer matched the shipped index, so a lookup written from the docs matched zero lines even
  for functions that are present — silently reporting a real function as "not in the corpus", the exact
  failure the skill exists to prevent. The doc now matches the compact index, uses a full-quoted-token match,
  and adds a self-check that validates the search against a known-present token before trusting an empty result.
- **Corrected attribution:** the bundled third-party notices now credit the distributor-grammar authors by
  name — Zzyxzz (SkyPatcher) and powerofthree (SPID + KID) — and list the KID-authoring skill.

## 1.1.1 — 2026-06-06

houseCARL now points you at your logs — completing the external-tool bridge.

- **Log folders in status:** `housecarl_load_order_status` now surfaces the resolved Papyrus script-log and
  SKSE crash-log folders, so houseCARL knows where to read them when you ask about a Papyrus error or a
  crash. Set a folder explicitly with `housecarl_set_tool_path` (`papyrus_logs` / `crash_logs`); when one is
  unset, houseCARL auto-detects the default location and says so, or tells you exactly how to point it at
  yours. Logs are the one bridge dependency with no wrapping tool — you Read the `.log` files directly.

## 1.1.0 — 2026-06-06

houseCARL now drives the external modding toolchain, not just the data layer.

- **Tool bridge:** `housecarl_set_tool_path` registers — and auto-detects — the external tools houseCARL
  wraps. When a tool a command needs isn't set, houseCARL fails loud with the exact path it wants, rather
  than silently doing nothing.
- **Papyrus compile:** `housecarl_compile_script` compiles a `.psc` through the Creation Kit's
  `PapyrusCompiler.exe`. Compiler warnings are non-fatal, and the recompile is non-destructive — the
  existing `.pex` is overwritten only when the compile succeeds.
- **BSA archives:** `housecarl_bsa_list`, `housecarl_bsa_extract`, and `housecarl_bsa_repack` wrap BSArch
  to inspect, extract from, and repack `.bsa` archives. Repack is non-destructive — the target archive is
  replaced only when the pack succeeds.

## 1.0.1 — 2026-06-05

- **Descendable reads:** `housecarl_read_record` / `housecarl_batch_record_detail` gain a `depth`
  parameter. `depth=1` (default) is unchanged; `depth>=2` enumerates the contents of lists,
  dictionaries, and sub-structs — each element shown with its index and an identity (e.g.
  `VirtualMachineAdapter.Scripts[0].Properties[5] = [ScriptObjectProperty] Name=...`) — so nested
  elements and their indices are visible in one call instead of probing each `[i]` by hand.
- **Bracket-grammar discoverability:** reading a collection with a dot-index (e.g. `Aliases.0`) now
  returns an actionable hint to use brackets (`Aliases[0]`); bracket indexing is documented in the
  read/write tool descriptions.

## 1.0.0 — 2026-06-03

Initial release.

- Local MCP server (stdio) with [Mutagen](https://github.com/Mutagen-Modding/Mutagen) kept warm in
  memory. Claude Code launches it — no port, no window, no manual start.
- **Reads:** the true load-order winner for any record, plus the full conflict tree on request; batch
  record detail; cross-plugin queries.
- **Writes:** set / add / remove fields, leveled-list and container edits, condition-target
  re-targeting — emitted as a **new** MO2 mod folder (`houseCARL - <name>`), originals untouched.
  Create brand-new records; remove records and individual entries; unused masters cleaned automatically.
- **Reflection-driven coverage:** every record type Mutagen models is readable and writable by
  construction — not a hand-maintained subset.
- **MO2 integration:** the instance is chosen via a folder picker at enable time; the active profile and
  load order are read statically from the instance's profile files and refresh automatically on the next
  tool call (MO2 need not be running).
- **Bundled skills:** `mutagen-reference` (record schemas), `papyrus-reference` (Papyrus + SKSE
  signatures), `skypatcher-authoring`, `spid-authoring`, and `kid-authoring`.
