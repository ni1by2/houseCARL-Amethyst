// ======================================================================
//  AssetRenameService — carry FormID-KEYED assets across a renumber (compact/merge Wave A1).
//
//  THE PROBLEM (research MERGE_REFERENCE_RESEARCH_2026-06-26 §3 / §8): renumbering a plugin's
//  records (compact's RenumberModInto) moves every record to a NEW FormID, but the asset FILES
//  the engine looks up BY that FormID — FaceGen head meshes/tints, voice .fuz/.lip — keep their
//  OLD-FormID names. The engine then can't find them at the new FormID, so a compacted NPC mod
//  silently dark-faces and a voiced mod goes mute. xEdit/zMerge/Merge Plugins all rename these
//  along the same old→new map; houseCARL must too, or compact is a Q3 "silently degraded mode".
//
//  This is the shared SPINE both compact and merge ride: given the renumber's old→new FormKey map
//  and the written P′, carry each renumbered record's FormID-keyed assets to their NEW-FormID
//  paths under the P′ mod folder. A1 covers FACEGEN (the dominant break — the dark-face bug);
//  A2 covers VOICE (.fuz/.lip — a compacted voiced mod otherwise goes mute) — A1+A2 ride ONE shared
//  two-phase carry (CarryItems), so the in-place aliasing fix (PR #123) lives in exactly one place,
//  never two diverging copies. A3 covers SEQ (RegenerateSeq) — NOT a map-rename carry: a .seq lists
//  each start-game-enabled quest's master-relative on-disk FormID, every one of which a renumber
//  shifts, so a .seq the source SHIPPED is REBUILT from P′ (SeqFile.Build), not renamed. It is
//  REFRESH-ONLY — if the source shipped no .seq, compaction does NOT invent one (parity with xEdit's
//  ESL compaction, which never touches the .seq); inventing a file other compaction tools don't is
//  the surprise we avoid. The missing-.seq case is a NAMED advisory, never a silent write. Strings
//  stay OUT of the spine — plugin-name-keyed, untouched by a renumber (a merge-only edge, not a break).
//
//  COMPOSES existing, Aaron-locked primitives — NO new path logic:
//    • FaceGenPath.For / VoicePath (the pure FormKey→path transforms; folder = the FormKey's
//      defining master, so For(oldKey) and For(newKey) give the correct OLD and NEW paths).
//    • AssetResolver (resolve the OLD path to its load-order WINNING on-disk bytes, loose or BSA;
//      EnumerateUnder lists what voice files actually exist under the plugin's voice prefix).
//    • AtomicFile.WriteAllBytes / Commit (the same crash-atomic place_asset uses).
//
//  Q3 — NEVER throws and NEVER fails the compact: the RECORDS are already written correctly by the
//  time this runs; an asset it can't carry is a NAMED warning in the outcome, not a crash. An NPC
//  with NO own facegen is NORMAL (vanilla/inherited head), not a failure — only an asset that was
//  FOUND but couldn't be written is a warning. A BSA that failed to read is surfaced (ReadIncomplete)
//  so "no facegen"/"no voice" is never silently trusted.
//
//  WHY VOICE SCANS DISK (A2 discovery, strategy b): a facegen path is a PURE FormKey transform, but a
//  voice filename embeds the parent quest/topic EditorIDs, the voice type, AND a response number —
//  none of which a renumber changes. On a compact the plugin keeps its basename, so ONLY the
//  '00<6hex>' id segment differs old→new. So instead of re-deriving the dialogue graph per INFO
//  (which silently misses radiant/quest-alias lines whose graph won't resolve), CarryVoice ENUMERATES
//  the voice files actually present under Sound\Voice\<plugin>\ and rewrites the id segment of each
//  whose embedded FormID was renumbered — catching every file the engine would lose, the way
//  zMerge/xEdit do it. Matching is purely by the on-disk filename, so it needs no record readback.
//
//  NON-DESTRUCTIVE: writes only the NEW-FormID copies under the P′ mod folder (the fresh folder in
//  the new-file lane; the target's own folder in the in-place lane). The OLD-FormID files are left
//  untouched — harmless orphans the engine no longer looks up (project_nondestructive_output_policy).
