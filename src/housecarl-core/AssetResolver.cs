// ======================================================================
//  AssetResolver — determine which active source provides an asset and which copy wins.
//  (facegen-diagnostics step 1; Aaron-locked 2026-06-14).
//
//  Product mode receives Amethyst's authoritative filemap/modindex winner map. It does not
//  reconstruct loose-file priority by walking deployed Data. Vanilla Data_Core is added as
//  the lowest loose source, and active BSA tables are supplied separately. The older root
//  walker remains temporarily for inherited regression probes.
//
//  PRECEDENCE (the dark-face bug is literally a desync of THIS with plugin load order):
//    • loose files BEAT BSA-packed — the engine loads BSAs first, loose files override them;
//    • among loose: Amethyst's indexed winner first, then vanilla Data_Core;
//    • among BSAs: the higher plugin-load-order rank wins.
//  WINNER = the top loose provider if ANY loose copy exists, else the top BSA provider.
//
//  Q3 — ALL providers are returned, not just the winner, plus an Ambiguous flag. Two mods
//  shipping the same facegen path is a CONTENTION worth surfacing (the contender list is the
//  diagnostic value) — though the dark-face bug proper is a record-winner-vs-file-winner desync
//  this phase only half-answers; and the precise loose-vs-BSA outcome has real MO2 edge cases (managed archives),
//  so the resolver models the common rule and FLAGS contention rather than asserting a
//  falsely precise single winner. A BSA that cannot be read is collected into BsaFailures and
//  surfaced, never silently treated as "absent".
//
//  CORNERSTONE (#3, Aaron 2026-06-14 — "I also think #3 is fine"): holds DERIVED DATA only
//  (cached BSA file-tables as string sets) and ZERO archive handles at rest. Each BSA is opened,
//  its table copied into a HashSet, and the reader dropped — Mutagen's reader does NOT keep the
//  archive mapped for the resolver's lifetime (the reader is not IDisposable in 0.53.1, so there
//  is no held handle to dispose — the asset-resolver-guard's at-rest arm proves the .bsa stays
//  renamable/deletable while the resolver is alive). Same ZERO-AT-REST property LoadOrderResolver
//  gives plugins, by a DIFFERENT mechanism — the plugin overlay there IS disposed; here there is
//  simply nothing held — so MO2/xEdit can still move/delete archives freely. Loose presence is a
//  PER-SUBTREE cache (the filename set under each requested
//  directory, in EACH loose root, warmed on first touch) — so a bulk facegen scan warms the small
//  facegendata subtree ONCE and the rest is O(1), not a File.Exists per (path × every enabled mod).
//  Both caches are mtime-invalidated via RefreshIfStale. Manager filemap membership changes
//  rebuild the resolver through IModManagerLayout; this class never guesses missing winners.
//
//  BSA reading uses Mutagen's NATIVE archive surface (Mutagen.Bethesda.Archives), in-process,
//  with NO BSArch dependency (BsaArchive.cs shells BSArch for pack/unpack — which Mutagen
//  cannot do — but LISTING a table it can). Decision #1 (2026-06-14): native, spike-verified
//  by the asset-resolver-guard probe.
//
//  ORDER IS INJECTED. Correct BSA precedence depends on the plugin ranks supplied by the
//  manager adapter; AssetResolver does not calculate plugin load order.
