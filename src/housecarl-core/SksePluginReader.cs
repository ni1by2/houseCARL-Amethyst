/// Tier A+C of the SKSE-plugin-layer visibility gap (bug report 2026-06-08_gap_skse-plugin-layer-visibility):
/// reads what an SKSE plugin DLL DECLARES about itself, STATICALLY — no loading, no execution, no runtime state.
/// The whole capability's hard ceiling is tier E (DLL *behavior*), which stays UNREACHABLE by design; this reader
/// stops at the declared manifest, exactly the trustworthy line.
///
/// The mechanism, confirmed empirically against the live load order (297 real DLLs) and anchored to the two
/// CommonLib lineages' identical <c>SKSE::PluginVersionData</c> layout (alandtse/CommonLibVR@ng and
/// powerof3/CommonLibSSE@dev):
///
///   • The AE-era SKSE loader reads an exported DATA BLOB named <c>SKSEPlugin_Version</c> without executing the
///     DLL (plugin-skeleton.md §1), so its bytes are a static manifest: plugin name, author, version, the
///     version-independence flags (Address Library / signature-scanning / struct-compat), the compatible-runtime
///     list, and the XSE version floor. That is the whole of tier C, and it is what a modern plugin exports.
///   • The older SE/VR loader instead CALLS an exported FUNCTION <c>SKSEPlugin_Query</c> that fills its info at
///     runtime — so a query-ONLY (no <c>SKSEPlugin_Version</c>) plugin's metadata is NOT statically readable. We
///     classify it <see cref="SksePluginKind.LegacyQuery"/> and say so (Q3: an honest "can't read this
///     statically", never an invented name).
///   • A DLL in SKSE\Plugins with NONE of the SKSE exports is a bundled dependency, not a plugin
///     (<see cref="SksePluginKind.NotSkse"/>) — e.g. CrashLogger's msdia140.dll.
///
/// The struct layout is load-bearing and was VALIDATED byte-for-byte (SPID → "Spell Perk Item Distributor" /
/// "powerofthree", flags 0x5 = AddressLibrary|UpdatedStructs; OAR → AddressLibrary|NoStructs, compat 1.6.1170) —
