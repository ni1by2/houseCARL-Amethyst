/// <summary>
/// The shared foundation under the plugin-surgery cluster — compact (renumber a plugin into the ESL range), merge
/// (combine plugins into a new one), and their ride-alongs (COMPACT_MERGE_PLAN_2026-06-26 §3). All four operations
/// reduce to the SAME three primitives this engine exposes; the compact/merge MCP tools (later waves) are thin policy
/// layers over them. Built index-free on Mutagen's forward <c>RemapLinks</c> pass (the reverse-ref index is deferred,
/// for its own value — pre-check 2026-06-26: speed/feature fix, NOT a dependency).
///
/// THE MECHANISM, pinned empirically (remap-wave1-mech, this session) — the plan's §4 "assign new FormIDs in place"
/// was a TRAP and is NOT what we do:
///   • <c>mod.RemapLinks(old→new dict)</c> repoints a record's OUTGOING references ONLY — it does NOT move a record's
///     own identity. (Wave-0 proved this half; the mechanism probe re-confirmed it.)
///   • A record's own <c>FormKey</c> setter IS reachable but is NON-PUBLIC, and setting it leaves the FormKey-keyed
///     group cache STALE (ContainsKey(new)=false, ContainsKey(old)=true) — a silent-corruption trap. REJECTED.
///   • The CORRECT renumber is the PUBLIC <c>record.Duplicate(newFormKey)</c> (Mutagen's blessed deep-copy under a new
///     identity) into a FRESH mod, then <c>RemapLinks(dict)</c> to repoint the internal references. The fresh target
///     starts empty, so renumbering never collides with an as-yet-unmoved record. Group state stays consistent.
///
/// COVERAGE BOUNDARY (Q3, honest — never a silent drop):
///   • <see cref="IdentifyExternalReferencers"/> and <see cref="RepointInPlace"/> handle EVERY record type — they only
///     read/mutate a record's outgoing links (Mutagen's by-construction <see cref="IFormLinkContainerGetter"/> surface),
///     which is nesting-agnostic. Full coverage.
///   • <see cref="RenumberRecordsInto"/> places duplicated records via the FLAT top-level groups
///     (<see cref="WriteEngine.EnumerateFlatGroups"/>). Records that live ONLY in NESTED groups (Cell, the Placed*
///     family, INFO under a topic, navmesh, landscape) have no flat group and are REFUSED LOUD here — the nested
///     duplicate-into placement is the next wave's work, not silently skipped.
///
/// At-rest discipline (Option B / CLAUDE.md §1): every method opens at most ONE plugin mutable at a time
/// (<c>CreateFromBinary</c>, the anti-trap single-plugin lane) and disposes master overlays after the write — the
/// load order is never held parsed.
