/// <summary>
/// The SCRIPT-PROPERTY binding sweep (housecarl_validate_scripts): for every record carrying a VMAD it cross-checks
/// the properties BOUND on the record's script attachment against the properties the attached script's compiled
/// <c>.pex</c> — and its whole <c>extends</c> chain — actually DECLARES, and reports the ones that are declared but
/// left UNBOUND (a silent <c>None</c>). This is the failure the bug store names on 2026-07-04: a quest script declared
/// <c>Spell Property CallVesyraPower Auto</c>, the code guarded on it, the VMAD never bound it → <c>AddSpell(None)</c>
/// no-op while the trace logged "power granted". Maximally misleading (function runs, effect absent, logs clean), and
/// the same class as the CK's STMain auto-add bug — every scripted mod hits it eventually.
///
/// WHY THIS IS A COMPOSE-PRIMITIVES JOB (no new dependency, the <see cref="ErrorCheck"/> pattern): both halves are
/// already modeled. The RECORD half is Mutagen's VMAD (<see cref="IHaveVirtualMachineAdapterGetter"/> →
/// <see cref="IAVirtualMachineAdapterGetter.Scripts"/> → <see cref="IScriptEntryGetter"/> with its bound
/// <see cref="IScriptPropertyGetter"/> list) — PLUS a QUEST's alias-attached scripts (<see cref="IQuestAdapterGetter.Aliases"/>),
/// collected by <see cref="CollectScriptEntries"/> so an alias-bound property isn't silently skipped. The SCRIPT half is
/// Mutagen's <c>.pex</c> model (<see cref="PexObject.Properties"/>,
/// each an <see cref="PexObjectProperty"/> with its <c>Auto</c> flag + declared type) — the same model
/// <see cref="PapyrusDecompiler"/> reads. The two are joined through the VFS: <see cref="AssetResolver"/> resolves
/// <c>Scripts\&lt;class&gt;.pex</c> (loose OR BSA-packed), and each <c>.pex</c> self-declares its parent
/// (<see cref="PexObject.ParentClassName"/>), so the extends chain walks itself with no external hierarchy map.
///
/// WHAT COUNTS AS A FINDING (kept HIGH-SIGNAL so a clean result is trustworthy and the sweep never cries wolf — Q3):
///   • UNBOUND OBJECT property — an <c>Auto</c> property of a FORM/object type (Spell, Quest, ObjectReference, …)
///     declared in the chain but absent from the VMAD. Unbound ⇒ <c>None</c> ⇒ the silent-no-op footgun. HIGH.
///   • UNBOUND SCALAR property with NO initializer — an <c>Auto</c> Int/Float/Bool/String declared without a baked
///     default and absent from the VMAD ⇒ defaults to 0 / 0.0 / false / "" which may be wrong (a "% chance" meant to
///     be 50 silently becomes 0). MEDIUM. A scalar that DOES carry an initializer is NOT flagged — it has the author's
///     intended default, so leaving it unbound is correct, not a bug.
///   • BOUND-BUT-NULL object property — present in the VMAD as a <see cref="IScriptObjectPropertyGetter"/> whose Object
///     link is null AND which is not bound to a quest alias instead (Alias &lt; 0). The same <c>None</c> at runtime, but
///     MORE often intentional (the slot exists, filled at runtime), so it is ADVISORY, ranked below the absent findings.
///
/// HONEST BOUNDARY (Q3 — the sweep claims exactly this, never more, and every degraded mode is NAMED, never silent):
///   • It checks <c>Auto</c> properties only — the CK-editable, silently-defaulting kind. Full properties with custom
///     Get/Set handlers are code-driven and are not flagged.
///   • "Unbound may be intentional" — an object property is sometimes filled by script at runtime; the finding is a
///     flag to VERIFY, not a proven defect. Object-type absences are ranked first because they are the silent-None class.
///   • If a script's OWN <c>.pex</c> is not on disk (uncompiled, or not in the VFS) the attachment is reported
///     UNVERIFIABLE, never silently passed. If an ANCESTOR <c>.pex</c> is missing the chain is truncated with a named
///     note — the properties we COULD read are still checked.
///   • A BSA that failed to read this build is surfaced (<see cref="AssetResolver.AssetView.ReadIncomplete"/>), so a
///     "not found" that may merely be unscanned is never read as an authoritative absence.
///
/// Composes existing primitives only, holds nothing past each record (the <see cref="ErrorCheck"/> Option-B discipline):
/// the per-plugin record stream (<c>RecordsIn</c>), the VFS resolver (one captured <see cref="AssetResolver.AssetView"/>
/// so every <c>.pex</c> lookup + the read-incomplete caveat agree on ONE build), and per-record fault isolation.
