// ======================================================================
//  LoadOrderResolver — the net-new load-order resolver (MCP step §8.3, fork §6-C).
//
//  This is the read-side capability §5.2 of the PRFAQ specifies, realized:
//    held structural index (small) + on-demand targeted parse, holding no record bodies —
//    AND, under Option B (Aaron-locked 2026-06-04), holding NO PLUGIN FILE HANDLES AT REST.
//
//  SHAPE (Aaron-confirmed 2026-06-01 off the body-fetch probe; handle model proven by handle-probe 2026-06-04):
//    • Held index — PURE DATA, ZERO file handles — built by enumerating every plugin ONE AT A TIME (low→high
//      priority: open i → enumerate → DISPOSE → i+1, never all-open-at-once):
//        - Index     : FormKey → (winnerOverlay, overrideCount)  — ALL keys, the O(1) "what wins" fast path (§8.1).
//        - Overriders: FormKey → ordered overlay indices          — MULTI-override keys ONLY (the "list of touching
//                        plugins" §5.2 calls for; singletons' sole overrider IS the winner, so they need no list).
//      ~125–185 MB at full-modlist scale (within §5.2's "few hundred MB"); NO record bodies, NO mmap handles held.
//    • On-demand body fetch = open the plugin, re-enumerate + match the FormKey, then DISPOSE when the work ends.
//      A per-call OverlaySession (see OpenSession) opens each plugin a tool call touches AT MOST ONCE and disposes
//      every one when the call returns. Measured (handle-probe 2026-06-04): open/read/dispose ~0.3–0.8 ms, invisible
//      under the 200–2000 ms LLM round-trip; no leak. The write path takes its known-master set + a nested-override
//      link cache from the SAME session, so a write opens handles only for its own duration too.
//    • mtime freshness = re-stat the plugin files on demand; rebuild the index (one-at-a-time again) if any changed.
//      Manager/profile freshness is handled by the Amethyst adapter before it supplies a new ordered path list; this
//      core type deliberately knows nothing about profiles, deployment, filemaps, or manager configuration.
//
//  WHY zero handles at rest (Option B): the original Windows implementation exposed how a mapped overlay could block
//  atomic replacement. Linux normally permits replacement while an old inode is open, but retaining thousands of
//  overlays would still waste resources and let a reader observe obsolete inode contents after a staging write.
//  Opening only within a short session therefore remains the portable and least surprising lifetime model.
//
//  ORDER IS INJECTED. Build takes the plugin paths already in priority order. Override COUNTS/DEPTHS and tree
//  MEMBERSHIP are order-independent; winner IDENTITY is only as correct as that input. AmethystLoadOrder is
//  responsible for interpreting the active profile, loadorder.txt, Data_Core, and staging sources before this class
//  is built. Keeping that boundary here prevents manager formats from leaking into the record engine.
//
//  Q3 (no silent failure): a plugin the index build cannot fully read — it won't OPEN, or it contains a
//  record Mutagen cannot PARSE (a strict-validation throw mid-enumeration; the common real case is a
//  malformed subrecord an upstream ESP ships and the game engine ignores) — is EXCLUDED wholesale and the
//  reason is COLLECTED + surfaced (LoadFailures / ExcludedPlugins → load_order_status), never skipped
//  silently. ONE such record used to kill the whole build (bricking EVERY tool call, since all resolve
//  through this index); now it costs only its own plugin. The throw is non-resumable, so we can't skip just
//  the bad record (Mutagen 0.53.1: the group enumerator can't advance past it) — exclusion is per-PLUGIN,
//  and atomic (a partially-read plugin never half-populates the index). A body the index says exists but the
//  plugin can't yield still throws (a real inconsistency, named).
