// ======================================================================
//  DialogueCkParity — the CK-parity default-populate authority for the DIAL/INFO/DLVW family.
//
//  THE ONE ASYMMETRY THIS EXISTS FOR (community reports, Heisen + Junti, 2026-07-02..04):
//    Mutagen OMITS a null/unset optional subrecord on write. The Creation Kit writes it UNCONDITIONALLY,
//    nulls included. So a record authored through houseCARL that sets only the fields the author cared about
//    differs STRUCTURALLY from a CK-authored one of the same content — and for several members of this family
//    that difference is a hard failure (a CK-editor access violation the moment the topic/view is opened).
//    There is no second mechanism; the whole class closes by default-populating the nullable fields the CK
//    always emits, at record CREATE time, inside the Mutagen model (no byte-injection, no xEdit — every field
//    here is fully modeled; confirmed via mutagen-reference).
//
//  THIS IS THE SAME FIX AS #131 (the DialogTopic SNAM marker), generalised to the rest of the family. It holds
//  the three #131 invariants for every default (see DialogueSubtype's header for the original statement):
//    1. NON-OVERRIDE — fill ONLY when the author left the field null/unset; NEVER clobber an explicit value.
//    2. NEVER SILENT (Q3) — every fill is returned as a CkParityFill the create path surfaces as an OpResult
//       (label + reason), visible in the write read-back. Nothing is populated behind the author's back.
//    3. BY CONSTRUCTION — the defaults are the values a CK-authored record of the same content carries
//       (byte-verified against this load order's reference plugins, e.g. Talos' Tease), not invented; the
//       dialogue-ckparity-guard pins each one.
//
//  SCOPE (S1 — the confirmed-CK-crash tier). Each field below is a nullable Mutagen field the CK writes
//  unconditionally, with a CONFIRMED editor crash when omitted (Heisen §3 gap-2 / gap-3, INFO-DATA report):
//    • INFO (DialogResponses) FavorLevel (CNAM)   → None
//    • INFO (DialogResponses) Flags    (ENAM)     → empty DialogResponseFlags (Flags=0, ResetHours=0)
//    • DLVW (DialogView)      DNAM                → 0x00
//    • DLVW (DialogView)      ENAM                → 0x00000000
//
//  SCOPE (S2 — the byte-only tier). Same asymmetry, no confirmed crash — a byte mismatch vs a CK-authored record
//  (Confidence BYTE). Every default VALUE below was byte-verified against CK-authored vanilla records in a live load
//  order (2026-07-04) before it was committed, per the plan's "fill the correct value, not a guessed one" gate:
//    • DLBR (DialogBranch)   Category   (TNAM)     → Player  (the enum's zero-value AND 3059/3061 vanilla branches,
//                                                    across all Flags; the rare Command branch is author-set → non-override)
//    • DIAL (DialogTopic)    Priority   (PNAM)     → 50      (the CK seed for an untouched topic; the dominant value
//                                                    on vanilla Custom topics — NON-NULLABLE float, see below)
//    • QUST (Quest)          NextAliasID (ANAM)    → next-alias-ID counter: max(existing alias ID)+1, else 0
//    • QUST QuestObjective   Flags      (FNAM)     → 0 (no flags), materialised per objective
//    • QUST QuestAlias       Flags      (FNAM)     → 0 (no flags), materialised per alias
//    • QUST QuestAlias       VoiceTypes (VTCK)     → null-link (0x00000000), materialised per alias
//
//  SCOPE (S3 — the in-game-behavior tier). The same omitted-subrecord asymmetry, but the consequence is neither a
//  CK-editor crash (S1) nor a byte-only mismatch the game shrugs off (S2): the RUNNING GAME behaves WRONG (#212).
//    • DLBR (DialogBranch)   Flags      (DNAM)     → 0 (no flags)
//  An ABSENT DNAM is read by the engine as TopLevel, so a branch the author never marked top-level is published to
//  the player's dialogue menu anyway — a nameless Say()-only topic surfaces as a selectable "..." that fires its
//  lines on click. The output is byte-valid and passes validate_dialogue, so nothing catches it before the game
//  does; that combination (valid-looking, silently wrong) is what makes this the sharpest tier, not the mildest.
//
//  ONE S2 FIELD IS NOT NULLABLE — DIAL Priority is a plain float that defaults to 0, so "the author left it unset"
//  can't be read off is-null the way every other field here is. The create path detects it from the AUTHOR'S OP LIST
//  (did any edit touch the Priority path?) and passes that in; a fill happens only when Priority was never mentioned,
//  and an explicit value — INCLUDING 0 — always wins. That's why ApplyTopicPriorityDefault takes an authorSetPriority
//  flag while the nullable-field methods don't. See ApplyTopicPriorityDefault + the create-lane call.
//
//  Add S3+ defaults here too — do not fork a parallel path.
//
//  A SEMANTIC NON-DEFAULT worth stating: the `Goodbye` conversation-ender flag lives INSIDE the INFO Flags
//  struct this fills. Materialising Flags to all-zero does NOT set Goodbye — a conversation-ending line still
//  needs Flags.Flags = Goodbye set explicitly (that's an authoring choice, not a CK-parity default). The
//  dialogue-authoring skill carries that semantic.
