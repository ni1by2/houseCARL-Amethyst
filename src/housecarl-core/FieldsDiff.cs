/// The winner-relative CONTENT comparison behind the conflict-tree diff (HCBR-2026-06-09-01).

/// The old diff compared depth-1 rendered lines, where a list collapses to a "[List: N item(s)]" count
/// token — so two lists with EQUAL counts but DIFFERENT contents compared identical, and a whole override
/// could be reported "(identical to winner)" while carrying the very edit that motivated it (the report's
/// masked USSEP PlayerFaction regression). This module compares DEEP reads (every modeled leaf):
///
///   • scalar / substruct / dict leaves — exact-path token comparison (the old behavior, at full depth).
///     Dict brackets are semantic KEYS — non-numeric (Skills[OneHanded]) by spelling, numeric-keyed dicts
///     (Package.Data) by the read engine's in-band "N pair(s)" container marker — so a key rebinding is a
///     real delta, never absorbed by positional handling;
///   • positional LIST contents — order-INSENSITIVE multiset comparison of whole elements keyed on their
///     content (the report's case: USSEP and the winner store the same relations in different orders, so
///     an index-wise comparison would over-report; element identity is content-based). Elements present
///     on only one side are reported with identifying leaf values. Nested list reordering INSIDE an
///     element is not canonicalised (v1) — it can over-report as a content delta, never under-report;
///   • honesty (Q3) — if either side's deep read hit the expansion cap, <see cref="Result.Complete"/> is
///     false: list comparison and one-sided-presence deltas are SUPPRESSED (where the two caps fell would
///     otherwise fabricate differences), only value mismatches observed on both sides are reported, and
///     the caller must not claim identity beyond what was actually compared.
