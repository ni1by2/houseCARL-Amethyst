/// The "you probably dropped the root folder" suggestion for an asset path that resolved to nothing (#273).
///
/// THE PAPERCUT: a model path read straight off a record — <c>Model.File</c> on an NPC / ARMA / STAT — is stored
/// relative to <c>meshes\</c>, but every asset tool wants it Data-relative. Passing the record's own value verbatim
/// is therefore the NORMAL way one arrives at a mesh, and it returns a flat ABSENT with nothing saying why. The
/// answer is true for the string as given, so this is not a wrong answer — but the caller has to already know the
/// convention to get past it, and spends a round trip discovering it.
///
/// VERIFIED, NEVER GUESSED — the house posture for suggestions (<see cref="PluginNameSuggest"/>: a wrong "did you
/// mean" is worse than none). This does not pattern-match the path or reason about what it looks like; it RE-RESOLVES
/// the prefixed candidate through the same asset view and returns it only if a real active mod or BSA provides it.
/// A suggestion that comes back therefore always names a file that exists. If nothing hits, nothing is suggested,
/// and the caller is free to say the weaker, honest thing instead ("that field is stored relative to meshes\")
/// without claiming any file exists.
///
/// Cost: one extra snapshot lookup per already-failed path, on a path that is by definition not in the hot loop.
