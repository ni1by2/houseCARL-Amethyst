//  (housecarl_skse_inventory peek=true; plan dev/plans/SKSE_TIER_D_STATIC_PEEK_PLAN_2026-07-16.md).
//
//  Tier D answers "what does this unfamiliar DLL's IMAGE statically contain" — its imports (which ride
//  the manifest read in SksePluginReader, because they're free there) and the high-signal strings it
//  embeds, which live here because scanning a whole image is NOT free and so stays opt-in per-DLL.
//
//  The honest frame, and the reason this file filters instead of dumping: a string in an image is what
//  the image CONTAINS, never what the code DOES (tier E is the ceiling), and ABSENCE PROVES NOTHING —
//  RequiemLP.dll and YASTM.dll embed no plugin names at all, because their form references live in
//  configs or are built at runtime. "Nothing embedded" is therefore a fact about the image; it is never
//  "no dependencies". Every renderer of this data must carry that framing.
