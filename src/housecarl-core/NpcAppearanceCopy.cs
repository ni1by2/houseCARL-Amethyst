// ======================================================================
//  NpcAppearanceCopy — the record half of the composed standalone-NPC-copy verb
//  (capability chain Stage 3; STANDALONE_NPC_COPY_CAPABILITY_CHAIN_2026-07-02 §1).
//
//  THE MECHANISM: Mutagen's public record.Duplicate(newKey) + RemapLinks — the SAME
//  blessed deep-copy the RemapEngine pins (remap-wave1-mech), NOT a field-by-field
//  re-authoring. That choice is load-bearing: the 2026-07-01 build test proved two
//  appearance facts empirically (HDPT.Parts morph-.tri refs are load-bearing for
//  lip-sync; TextureLighting defaults to 0 = dark skin on fresh creates), and BOTH
//  traps are structurally impossible under a whole-record copy — Duplicate carries
//  every field, so there is no field for a future session to forget.
//
//  THE INTERNALIZE RULE (what gets deep-copied vs what stays a link):
//    a linked record is INTERNALIZED (duplicated into the patch under a new key) iff
//      • its defining plugin IS the donor's plugin (the plugin being standalone-ized
//        away from — even if currently active), OR
//      • it does not resolve in the ACTIVE load order (it would be a missing master).
//    Every other link (vanilla, active shared-resource mods) stays a link — the patch
//    masters it normally. Headpart EditorIDs are PRESERVED on the copies: the engine
//    maps facegeom shape names → headparts BY NAME (build-test-pinned), so renaming
//    them would silently regenerate a vanilla head.
//
//  CLONE-MODE STRIP (Q3 — a standalone clone must be donor-free, loudly):
//    after internalize + remap, any link on the clone still pointing into the donor
//    (or at an unresolvable key) is NON-appearance (factions, outfits, packages,
//    VMAD…). Those are STRIPPED — nullable link → null; list entry → removed;
//    nullable link-bearing substruct → null — and EVERY strip is reported by field
//    name. A non-strippable (required, non-list) foreign link is a LOUD refusal,
//    never a silent keep (it would drag the donor back in as a master).
