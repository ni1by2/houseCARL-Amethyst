/// <summary>
/// REGRESSION GUARD (standing CI instrument) for HCBR-2026-06-15-01 item 1.2 (PR-B) — the SameShape over-reject.
///
/// THE GAP: when a field exists on several ARMS of a polymorphic base, <see cref="CorpusRulebook"/>'s FindField
/// admits the path only if those arms AGREE in shape (<c>SameShape</c>) — one shape validates for whichever arm the
/// live element turns out to be. SameShape compared the raw <c>Nullable</c> flag and three raw assembly-qualified
/// CLR-type strings, so two arms that are WRITE-LEGAL-IDENTICAL but differ only by the <c>Nullable&lt;T&gt;</c>
/// wrapper over-rejected with "CONFLICTING shapes" — even though <see cref="WriteEngine"/>.Coerce unwraps
/// <c>Nullable&lt;T&gt;</c> and admits the identical value set on either arm. Re-walking the corpus, EXACTLY ONE
/// field is affected: <c>APerkEffect.Value</c> — <c>float</c> on <c>PerkEntryPointModifyActorValue</c>, <c>float?</c>
/// on <c>PerkEntryPointModifyValue</c>/<c>…ModifyValues</c>.
///
/// THE FIX (by construction): SameShape now compares the AQ types after unwrapping <c>Nullable&lt;T&gt;</c>
/// (mirroring the engine's own Coerce/CanCoerce) and drops the raw Nullable-bool equality; an AQ name that won't
/// resolve to a runtime Type falls back to raw-string equality, so a genuinely unknown type is never silently
/// widened (Q3). Every GENUINE difference — cardinality, display type, or a different underlying CLR type — still
/// rejects.
///
/// RED→GREEN: check A (the one over-reject — <c>APerkEffect.Value</c> reached through <c>Perk.Effects[0].Value</c>)
/// is RED before the fix ("CONFLICTING shapes") and GREEN after. Real-corpus genuine conflicts stay rejected (net
/// regression guards), each firing AT the SameShape gate ("CONFLICTING shapes" message — no
/// green-for-the-wrong-reason): C = <c>Condition.ComparisonValue</c> (formlink vs scalar, rejected at the
/// <c>a.Cardinality</c> clause), D = <c>APackageData.Data</c> (bool/uint/float, rejected at the display
/// <c>a.Type</c> clause). NOTE neither C nor D reaches the NEW <c>SameWriteLegalType</c> branch — they reject on a
/// clause this PR did not touch — and no corpus field has arms agreeing on every display facet yet differing only
/// by underlying CLR type. So E exercises that branch DIRECTLY on two synthetic FieldSchemas equal on every facet
/// SameShape checks before the AQ comparison: E1 (float vs int) must REJECT — the "different type bound under a
/// shared display name" defense the original docstring cites, RED-able if <c>SameWriteLegalType</c> were ever
/// neutered to always-agree; E2 (float vs float?) must AGREE — the loosen isolated at the AQ axis (RED under the
/// old raw-AQ-string equality). Apply-1 drives the SAME request A through
/// <see cref="WriteEngine"/>.ApplyVerb on an in-memory Perk carrying a live arm, locking the invariant "pre-flight
/// admits exactly what the runtime coerces" (GREEN before and after — apply was never the gate; pre-flight was).
///
/// Self-contained: the corpus checks use the GENERATED corpus.json (built into a unique temp dir on a fresh
/// checkout, exactly as <c>poly-field-descend-guard</c> does); the apply check is pure in-memory Mutagen — no
/// plugin file, no Skyrim.esm.

/// Run: <c>dotnet run --project src/housecarl-generator sameshape-agree-guard</c>
