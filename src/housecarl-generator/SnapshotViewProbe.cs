/// REGRESSION GUARD (standing CI instrument) for the snapshot-view capture discipline (HCBR-2026-06-11-02):
/// ONE logical operation answers EVERY question off ONE captured index build. PR #34 made each individual
/// resolver read internally consistent (the index swaps in as one immutable snapshot); the residue it left was
/// CROSS-VALUE: a service method issuing several resolver reads (Stats' four counters; ResolveRead's
/// excluded-check + winner + touching; CrossQuery's per-match winner fill next to its scan) could still mix TWO
/// adjacent builds in one response when a freshness rebuild landed mid-operation. The fix pins each operation to
/// a <see cref="LoadOrderResolver.IndexView"/> captured once at the top.
///
/// Self-contained, in the pattern of <c>pkcu-regression</c> / <c>source-display-guard</c>: synthesizes a
/// 2-plugin order ON DISK — a master with two weapons, an override plugin overriding one of them — then REWRITES
/// the override plugin (it stops overriding and brings its own new weapon instead) and triggers the REAL rebuild
/// path (<see cref="LoadOrderResolver.RefreshIfStale"/>). The mutation flips every observable: winner, depth,
/// touching list, RecordCount, ConflictCount, MaxDepth — so a value from the wrong build is provable.
///
/// Arms:
///   CONTROL — two captures straddling the rebuild DISAGREE about the winner: proves a rebuild really swaps the
///             build mid-session here, i.e. the hazard class the discipline closes is live in this environment.
///   PINNED  — the view captured BEFORE the rebuild still answers ALL-OLD after it (winner + depth + touching +
///             all counters from its own build, internally consistent). RED if any <c>IndexView</c> member ever
///             re-derefs the live <c>_snap</c> instead of the captured build — the exact regression class.
///   FRESH   — a capture taken AFTER the rebuild answers ALL-NEW, equally internally consistent (the view must
///             pin, not freeze: new operations see the new build).
///   SERVICE — drives the REAL <see cref="LoadOrderService"/> (ForGuard seam) on the post-rebuild order:
///             Stats() counters are one consistent set; ResolveRead's winner agrees with its OWN touching list
///             (winner == touching[^1]); CrossQuery's per-match winner/depth agree with the build that scanned
///             (the plugins= path — the same scan loop type= runs, no corpus needed). Behavioral cover that the
///             view refactor changed nothing on a stable order.
///
/// The mid-operation race itself can't be scheduled deterministically (no injection seam in the product paths —
/// by design); per the report, the practical gate is this structural one: the pinning mechanism proven across a
/// REAL rebuild + the service answering off it (code shape reviewed at the call sites).
