/// Exploratory probe for the active-patch write self-lock (Heisen bug report 2026-06-08): houseCARL fails to write
/// into a patch that is ACTIVE in the resolved load order, because <c>OverlaySession.AllMasters()</c> opens a
/// memory-mapped overlay on EVERY active plugin — INCLUDING the write target — and Mutagen then serializes directly
/// onto that same path while the map is still alive. Windows refuses the overwrite (IOException "used by another
/// process"), so the all-or-nothing write writes nothing.
///
/// This maps the Windows file-sharing semantics precisely, to decide the fix. The honest open question from the
/// triage: the report recommends "serialize to a temp + File.Replace" as a COMPLETE fix on its own — but on Windows
/// the final swap must still rename/delete the original, which the same non-shareable map may ALSO block. So we test:
///
///   A  direct overwrite while an overlay on the target is HELD          (= the current bug)            → expect FAIL
///   B  temp write + File.Replace  while the overlay is HELD             (report's "#1 alone")          → ?
///   B2 temp write + File.Move(overwrite) while the overlay is HELD      (the Move variant)             → ?
///   C  Dispose the overlay, THEN direct overwrite                       (release-then-write)           → expect OK
///   D  temp write (overlay HELD) → Dispose overlay → File.Replace       (temp + release-then-swap)     → expect OK
///   E  CreateFromBinary(target) [the extend read] → direct overwrite    (does the extend read lock?)   → expect OK
///   F  overlay HELD but EXCLUDED from WithLoadOrder, direct overwrite   (is the HANDLE the lock, not   → expect FAIL
///                                                                        merely its presence in WLO?)
///
/// F is the load-bearing distinction for the fix: if a held-but-excluded handle still blocks the write, the fix must
/// NOT OPEN an overlay on the target at all (skip its index in AllMasters), not merely drop it from the returned set.
