/// SELF-CONTAINED CI REGRESSION GUARD for CLEARING A NULLABLE SUBSTRUCT OR POLYMORPHIC field via Remove (S4 Track D —
/// D2 the VMAD "un-fragment" capability, plus the polymorphic follow-on). The whole capability is BY CONSTRUCTION:
/// CorpusGenerator reads a reference-typed substruct's OR polymorphic union field's NRT "?" annotation
/// (NullabilityInfoContext) and emits Nullable=true, so VerbLegality already permits Remove on it and ApplyScalarVerb's
/// Remove sets the property null — no new write path was added, the corrected schema completes it. This guard pins that
/// chain end to end (RED before the generator fix: every substruct/poly field was marked non-nullable, so VerbLegality
/// refused Remove and there was no way to un-fragment an INFO except remove_record + recreate):
///   PREFLIGHT-VMAD    — Remove DialogResponses.VirtualMachineAdapter (a nullable substruct) PASSES pre-flight.
///   PREFLIGHT-PROMPT  — Remove DialogResponses.Prompt (another nullable substruct) PASSES too — the fix is GENERAL,
///                       not VMAD-special-cased (both are nullable reference substructs Mutagen models with "?").
///   CONTROL-OBJBOUNDS — Remove Armor.ObjectBounds (a genuinely NON-nullable substruct) still REFUSES, naming
///                       'non-nullable' — proves the gate is nullability-DRIVEN, not "every substruct is now removable".
///   CONTROL-SET       — a PLAIN-VALUE Set on the VMAD substruct is STILL refused — this probe's fix (nullable-clear via
///                       Remove) touched nullability data, not the Set path, so a bare Value="0" (no compose) opens nothing.
///                       (VMAD's type DialogResponsesAdapter is itself composable, so the bare value is rerouted to the
///                       compose-or-navigate guidance — NOT a coercion failure; the refusal is what this control asserts.
///                       A COMPOSE Set on a composable substruct IS separately accepted — nested-create-guard SUBSTRUCT-SET-*.)
///   E2E-UNFRAGMENT    — an in-memory INFO carrying a VMAD, driven through the REAL WriteEngine.ApplyVerb Remove,
///                       comes back with VirtualMachineAdapter == null (was non-null) — the apply half, un-fragmented.
///   PREFLIGHT-POLY(2) — Remove a nullable standalone polymorphic field (Book.Teaches; Npc.Sound) PASSES — the same
///                       NRT read extends to union fields, general across them (the poly analog of PREFLIGHT-VMAD/PROMPT).
///   CONTROL-POLY-REQ  — Remove a genuinely NON-nullable poly field (MagicEffect.Archetype) still REFUSES — a required
///                       arm is never silently clearable. (Poly nullability is NOT a required-at-serialize signal and
///                       no gate keys on it — nullarm-guard B2; a truly-missing required arm fails at the serialize
///                       boundary, not here.)
