/// <summary>
/// SELF-CONTAINED CI REGRESSION GUARD for nested-record CREATE (nested/dialogue plan, Layer A), in the pattern of
/// upsert-guard / formid-floor-guard. Drives the REAL product path (WritePatchBuilder.CreateRecords) against a
/// SYNTHESIZED master in TEMP — NO Skyrim.esm, so it runs in CI (unlike the manual nested-create-proof, which samples
/// fixtures from vanilla Skyrim.esm). The synthesized master carries the three fixture shapes the mechanism nests
/// under: a Weapon (the can't-contain-a-child reject target), a DialogTopic (the unique-collection happy path), and an
/// interior Cell (the named-collection happy path + the ambiguous-collection reject).
/// Run: dotnet run --project src/housecarl-generator -- nested-create-guard
///
/// Arms (ALL required — a GREEN must mean "the contract holds", never "the scenario doesn't arise here"). They mirror
/// the manual proof's N1-N9:
///   ONESHOT   (N1) — topic + its first INFO created in ONE call (same-call sibling parent): both records allocated at
///                    the local 0x800+ floor, the INFO present in the topic's Responses on disk, distinct FormKeys.
///   MULTICHILD(N8) — topic + TWO INFOs in one call, the second carrying a field edit: all three created, both INFOs
///                    under the topic, the edited Prompt landed on the second.
///   INTOTOPIC (N2) — an INFO added to an EXISTING (master) topic by FormKey: the new INFO at the floor, present in
///                    the topic override's Responses (outcome (i), the unique collection derived by type).
///   INTOCELL  (N3) — a PlacedObject added to an EXISTING (master) cell, the collection named 'Persistent' (outcome
///                    (ii)): the new ref at the floor, present in the cell override's Persistent list.
///   REJ-NOPARENT(N4) — a nested type with NO parent refuses loud (the type isn't flat-createable), no file written.
///   REJ-BADPARENT(N5)— an INFO under a Weapon refuses loud ('cannot be created under' — the containment boundary),
///                    no file written.
///   REJ-AMBIG (N6) — a PlacedObject into a Cell with NO collection named refuses loud naming the candidate lists
///                    ('more than one' + 'Persistent') — the outcome-(ii) discriminator is required, never guessed.
///   REJ-FWDSIB(N7) — a child whose same-call sibling parent is declared LATER refuses loud ('earlier in this call').
///   EXTEND (was N9) — a parent created in a PRIOR into= call IS now resolvable (the N9 extend-gap fix): create a topic
///                    (call 1), then in a SECOND into= call add an INFO under it by FormKey — the INFO lands under the
///                    patch-carried topic. A GENUINELY-absent parent (in neither the load order nor the patch) still
///                    refuses loud, naming both.
///
/// Layer B unit A — same-call sibling reference (@editorid) as a FormLink VALUE (the PNAM order-chain + Topic back-link
/// in ONE bulk_create; S4 Track D extends it to FormLink-LIST Add/ReplaceAll):

///                        right same-call 0x800+ FormKeys on disk (the singular-Set keystone).
///   SIBREF-LISTADD     — a line's LinkTo Add=@sub-topic resolves to the same-call sub-topic's FormKey on disk (S4 Track
///                        D: the report's linked-menu scenario in ONE bulk_create — no two-pass create-then-bulk_apply).
///   SIBREF-LISTREPLACE — a line's LinkTo ReplaceAll=[@subA,@subB] resolves BOTH @-entries to same-call FormKeys (the
///                        whole-list gate accepts siblings mixed with literals; here both are siblings).
///   REJ-SIBFWD         — a field @ref to a sibling declared LATER refuses loud ('EARLIER in this call' — declared-earlier).
///   REJ-SIBFWD-LIST    — the list twin: a LinkTo Add=@laterSibling refuses the same way (declared-earlier holds on the list path).
///   REJ-SIBNONFL       — an @ref on a NON-FormLink field (FavorLevel) refuses loud ('only valid on a FormLink field' — the
///                        string-collision guard that keeps substitution scoped to formlinks).
///   REJ-SIBLIST-SETIDX — an @ref via a non-Add list verb (SetAtIndex, which IS verb-legal on a list) refuses — the sibling
///                        gate opens ONLY for Add (proves S4 Track D didn't over-widen to every list verb).
///   REJ-SIBDICT        — an @ref inside a dict Merge's Entries values refuses loud ('not inside a dict value' — no
///                        formlink-valued dict is modeled, so the dict half stays dormant-by-construction).
///   REJ-SIBAPPLY       — an @ref validated with a NULL sibling set (the Apply/set_field context) refuses at the rulebook —
///                        create-only scoping, so @editorid never becomes an accept-then-substitute-nothing hole (Q3);

///   REJ-SIBSTRAYSTRUCT   — a struct= riding alongside an admitted '@' value refuses at the gate (PR #166 review
///                          finding 1: apply's substitution recursion must never walk an unvalidated stray compose).
///   EXTEND-EDIT          — WritePatchBuilder.Apply(extend:true) resolves a target the PATCH ITSELF defines (created by a

///
/// ELEMENT-VALUE PRESENCE — the null-PRESENCE twin of the value-SHAPE gap above (PR #76 follow-up). Add/SetAtIndex on a

/// VoiceCheck runs as a post-create step: it walks the written patch to map each created INFO to its parent topic,

/// The master carries a VoiceType + an NPC (Voice -> it) + a Quest the topic points at; an AssetResolver over a TEMP
/// Data root (planted / absent .fuz) makes the present/silent verdict CI-testable with no real load order:

///                       local id _ ResponseNumber . fuz/.lip (verified empirically against real loose .fuz files).

///                       present, at exactly the computed path (the "WILL BE SILENT" path the create surfaces).
///   VOICE-PRESENT     — planting BOTH the .fuz and the .lip at the computed paths flips the SAME line to present
///                       (FuzPresent + LipPresent, winner = the Data root) — proves the path the check builds is the
///                       path the engine looks under (no silent-wrong path), and exercises both the .fuz and .lip legs.
///   VOICE-NOSPEAKER   — a created line with NO Speaker can't resolve a voice folder (the runtime quest-alias case): a
///                       NAMED undetermined reason naming Speaker, and NO line — never a false "fine" (Q3).
///   VOICE-MULTIRESP   — an INFO with two response lines numbered NON-sequentially (5, 2) yields two lines whose paths
///                       carry _5 / _2 — one presence check PER spoken response, keyed by the line's own ResponseNumber
///                       (a positional i+1 impl would emit {1,2} and fail).
///   VOICE-SAMECALL    — the speaker NPC and its VoiceType are created in the SAME bulk_create as the voiced INFO, so
///                       the speaker chain resolves through patchByKey (same-call records), not the load order.
///   VOICE-CHECKERROR  — the check run against a CORRUPT patch path surfaces on VoiceReport.CheckError and does NOT
///                       throw / does NOT lose the created records — the Q3 "never demote a successful create" safety net.
