/// (the "which copy is correct" judgment is the caller's / a skill's, not the tool's). Source bytes are read IN PROCESS —
/// a loose file, or a single entry out of a BSA via native Mutagen (no BSArch). The write is crash-atomic and
/// non-destructive (originals untouched; a failed fresh placement leaves no orphan). Honest (Q3): "wrote it" is NOT "it
/// wins" — the tool reports the current winner and the required Amethyst refresh/enable/deploy sequence, and never claims the fix took effect on
/// write. General asset-layer; the FaceGen / dark-face case is the headline use case, driven by the facegen skill (the
/// formid+kind input is its convenience — for any other file use asset_path).
