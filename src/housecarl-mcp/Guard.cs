/// a named error — the unguarded residue was the <see cref="LoadOrderService"/> resolver getter (freshness/IO
/// throws during a mid-call profile re-read) and the render layer's per-match reads — returns a NAMED error
/// string instead of escaping to the SDK, whose own catch genericizes to "An error occurred invoking '…'."
/// (the opaque dead end the binding shim exists to kill; see <see cref="ToolCallShim"/>).

/// Division of honesty with the shim: with every body wrapped HERE, the only exceptions still reaching the
/// shim's catch are pre-body (argument binding), so its "could not be bound" wording stays accurate — and this
/// guard's "the arguments bound fine" wording is accurate in turn, because a body only runs after binding
/// succeeded. Cancellation is rethrown — a cancelled request is the SDK's to finish, not a tool failure.
